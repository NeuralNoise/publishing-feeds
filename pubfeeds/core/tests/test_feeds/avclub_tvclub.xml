                <div><p>I’ve made this confession before, and I’m sure I’ll have reason soon to make it again: I often feel as I’ve missed something when I’m watching this show. Take, for instance, the transition between the end of last week’s episode and the beginning of tonight’s. Barrow, the psycho played by Doug Jones, had kidnapped Kira and taken her to a power station, apparently with the intention of killing her. Our heroes lit out in hot pursuit but are unable to prevent Barrow from striking Kira with a live electrical wire—which does not kill her, but instead causes some kind of supernatural power override that blacks out the town.

                <![CDATA[<img src=http://i.onionstatic.com/avclub/4441/67/16x9/565.jpg /><div><p>I’ve made this confession before, and I’m sure I’ll have reason soon to make it again: I often feel as I’ve missed something when I’m watching this show. Take, for instance, the transition between the end of last week’s episode and the beginning of tonight’s. Barrow, the psycho played by Doug Jones, had kidnapped Kira and taken her to a power station, apparently with the intention of killing her. Our heroes lit out in hot pursuit but are unable to prevent Barrow from striking Kira with a live electrical wire—which does not kill her, but instead causes some kind of supernatural power override that blacks out the town. Meanwhile, Isaac is in his room at Allison’s house, having a hissy fit and enduring a visitation from some masked, robed guys who as if Dr. Doom has joined Daft Punk.</p>
<p>That, I thought, was a cliffhanger, and I assumed that tonight’s episode would begin by showing what happened next at the power station. But instead, Scott, Kira, and Stiles are all at the police station, explaining to Scott’s frothing G-man father what happened. Naturally, he doesn’t believe a word of it, even though it’s all pretty much true, even when Scott and Kira insist that, earlier in the evening, they were chowing down on both sushi and pizza. Meanwhile, at the Argent’s, Allison and her dad finally break the door in and mop up poor Isaac, lying motionless in a pool of his own sweat and other bodily fluids. So the upshot is, I’m not sure where Barrow is supposed to have disappeared to, and I’m not sure that anyone on the show knows, either. But the opening does firmly establish the one thing we did already know: Isaac is <i>some</i> kind of useless.</p>
<p>This is an episode about carefully drawing precise distinctions, always an important thing in the <i>Teen Wolf</i> universe. For instance, the twins are still trying find a way to reinsert themselves into the show’s power structure, and Aidan is still not getting it. Ethan tries to reason with him: “Scott doesn’t care about power. He cares about people. Want to be a wolf in his pack? Try being a human in high school.” Ethan has an incentive to be a human in high school, since that’s his best play to get back into bed with Danny. Aidan still has his sights set on Lydia, but she has recently had an attitude adjustment and shoots him down: “You’re not just a bad boy, Aidan. You’re a <i>bad guy</i>!” All too true. Stiles is trying his own hand at being something of a bad guy, supplying Scott and Kira with key cards that will enable them to break into the sheriff’s office. Scott accepts them gratefully but is then suddenly moved to ask, “Did you steal these?” No, says Stiles, “I cloned ‘em, using the RFID emulator.” “Is that <i>worse</i> than stealing?” asks Scott. Stiles can only shrug: “It’s <i>smarter</i>!”</p>
<p>Scott and Kira need to break into the evidence room because there’s a photo there that Barrow took of Kira, in which she seems to be bathed in a golden astral soup. Scott recognizes that it’s important that no one sees that picture, because if anyone does, they’ll spread the word that the cell phone Barrow used takes crappy photos, and then stock will plummet. Mission accomplished, everyone heads over to the ginormous Halloween rave that Ethan and Aidan, angling for cool-kids-on-the-block standing, have gracious helped to stage in Derek’s garage. Unbeknownst to Derek, the place is packed to rafters with kids in glow-in-the-dark paint pogoing up and down to a techno dance beat. Isaac, naturally, thinks the point of a set-up like this must be to sit down with his girlfriend and have a good, detailed conversation about her ex. Allison, who by now knows that she has to take charge with this yoyo if anything is going to happen, fixes him with her archer’s eyes and says, “Do you want to talk about Scott, or do you want to paint my body?” Since he’s a teenage boy, I can’t give him high points for knowing that the right answer to that question is whichever answer contains the words “my body,” but I am relieved that I don’t have to think about the implications if he <i>hadn’t</i> known that.</p>
<p>Lydia, meanwhile, is still resisting the advances of the werewolf hottie, wandering through the colorful noise and talking about how, if she wanted to attend a rave, she’d set her time machine for the ‘90s. Before the night is over—before, in fact, Derek appears and loudly reclaims his personal space from the revelers—both she and Ethan have fallen victim to the mysterious masked dudes, and Stiles has contracted a bad case of the oblique hinties, telling Scott’s dad that both he and his father know “the real reason” that  he has a problem with the two of them, and, in the final scene, seeming to suggest that it is he who’s been leaving coded messages calling for the extermination of Kira. I look forward to seeing the start of next week’s episode, in the hope that it’ll be connected to this ending in a way that even I can make sense of.</p>

 a calculated risk in how it uses C.J. in “Portable Toilet.” By having her join
 Eileen, Rigby, and Mordecai for lunch, the episode positions her in precisely
 the spot that Margaret once occupied. Mordecai has so few female friends that
 comparisons are pretty much inevitable, but this is the first time since C.J.
 reentered Mordecai’s life that the show has actively played up the similarity
 in their narrative roles. And as far as tonight’s story is concerned, C.J. does
 not suffer from such a comparison, as she proves a fast friend for Eileen and a
 successful savior of our heroes. Indeed, “Portable Toilet” is so confident in
 C.J.’s success as a character that it has Rigby give what, for him, is the
 ultimate compliment: She’s pretty cool. All indications tonight suggest that
 she is now firmly ensconced as a member of the ensemble going forward, but Mordecai’s
 reaction to Rigby’s statement suggests that she may not be just friends with
 Mordecai for very long. This could so easily feel like <i>Regular Show </i>unsubtly replacing Margaret with a character who it
 insists is way cooler and way better just because it says so. This could all
 feel so forced.</p><p>For the most part, “Portable Toilet” avoids such traps. The
 closing observation about C.J.’s coolness is a tad on-the-nose, and it ignores
 the real point that this episode makes far more forcefully: Eileen is way, <i>way </i>cooler. After all, C.J. might have
 jumped into a moving helicopter—or a portable toilet attached to a moving
 helicopter, as she modestly points out—but Eileen was right there with her, and
 Eileen was the one who got C.J. to calm down and take some action.
 Perhaps <i>Regular Show </i>just treats
 Eileen’s awesomeness at this stage as a fait accompli; either way, if the
 heightened presence for C.J. affords for more organic opportunities to include
 Eileen in the gang’s adventures, I won’t complain. What makes C.J. seem
 promising is that this episode takes great care to define her as someone very
 different from Margaret. The former object of Mordecai’s affections was many
 things—nice, kind, sweet, and willing to take Mordecai down a peg when he
 needed it—but she wasn’t really “cool,” at least not like C.J. is here.
 Margaret was at best a joiner in <i>Regular
 Show</i>’s craziness, but more often she was the good-natured bystander. It’s
 hard to imagine her intentionally daring Mordecai to eat a sandwich in a
 portable toilet, especially if it were just on a random impulse. A lovesick Mordecai
 might have convinced himself that such a stunt would impress Margaret, but she
 still wouldn’t be the natural instigator of mayhem that C.J. is in this
 episode.</p><p>On that point, a crucial moment of “Portable Toilet” comes
 when C.J. starts to freak out about Rigby and Mordecai’s fate at the army base.
 Her cloudy complexion turns positively thunderous, recalling her terrifying
 meltdown way back in “Yes Dude Yes.” Eileen is able to talk her down before
 anything serious happens—because, again, Eileen can do anything—but that sequence
 reaffirms that C.J. has her own distinct emotional existence. Her feelings have
 meaning and validity even when Mordecai is not around to react to them. This is
 also a sign that <i>Regular Show </i>is not
 abandoning the more negative aspects of C.J.’s character. She has the most
 obvious flaw of any of the show’s recurring female characters, and that fact
 should hopefully allow the creative team to tell more emotionally complex
 stories moving forward. What’s more, the ending to C.J.’s story doesn’t have to
 be an unhappy one, as this story proves she can avoid the kind of destructive
 behavior she displayed in “Yes Dude Yes,” provided she has friends around to
 stand by her. In terms of these emotional issues, she now seems less like a
 ticking time bomb and more like someone that Mordecai can come through for when
 she needs him most. After all, he does owe her one.</p><p><i>Regular Show </i>feels
 reenergized creatively, and that extends to the elements of tonight’s episode
 that don’t spotlight the show’s new recurring player. “Portable Toilet” pulls
 off a clever pacing trick in how it cuts to black after Mordecai and Rigby tip
 over the toilet. It’s as though the episode is restarting when we then see
 Muscle Man and Hi-Five Ghost discussing their weekend plans; that split-second pause
 and shift of scene makes the episode’s scope feel larger than could be contained
 in the show’s perennially short running time. The animation of the toilet
 replacement is spectacular, as the wind kicked up by the helicopter’s whirling
 propeller momentarily reshapes the environment beneath it. <i>Regular Show </i>is an old hand at blending the mundane and the
 incredible, but that first helicopter sequence feels like something slightly
 different from what we’re used to. The scene feels casually epic, as though the
 members of the creative team used a helicopter to take away the fallen toilet instead
 of, say, a delivery van just because they felt like it. The helicopter—more
 specifically, its impressive physical presence—is only tangential to the
 central absurdity of the episode, and so it contributes to the sense that we
 are glimpsing only one small part of a much larger world. Plus, the happiness
 that Muscle Man shows when he learns that the portable toilets receive such honorable
 deaths is much funnier when he has to shout it over the din of the helicopter. He also gets in a couple great jokes later on, particularly his insistence to Eileen and “other girl”—a wise acknowledgment of the fact that there’s no reason anyone else at the park should know C.J. just yet—that none of what is going on is actually awkward... at least until he learns he may have sent Mordecai and Rigby to their deaths at an army base.</p><p>Speaking of which, the general and his two subordinates represent three of the funniest one-off characters in the show’s history. Some
 of their humor could be said to be rooted in comedy of the random, but what
 makes their scenes really funny are the patterns that emerge. For reasons that
 go unexplained, the general has absolutely no interest in hearing what one of
 his men has to say but always has time to let the other speak freely. The
 general proudly proclaims that the president is not his father, but he groans like
 a sullen teenager when he is told that the president has called for him. The
 actual rationale for the destruction of the toilets is wonderfully flimsy, as
 the general claims that these movable commodes are exactly like the enemy, so why wouldn’t they spend three billion dollars a pop to blow up practice
 toilets with a laser from outer space? If I <i>really
 </i>felt like massively overreaching, I could probably argue that that whole
 business represents <i>Regular Show</i>’s
 stab at political commentary. In any event, all the talk of armies and enemies
 feels slightly more adult than the show’s standard fare, which is safely
 removed from the horrors of the real world, if only because Mordecai and Rigby
 spend most of their time fending off the horrors of this imaginary world. The
 handling of the military here is just one bold, surprising element in an episode
 full of them. If this is the new norm for <i>Regular Show</i>, we are in for exciting times ahead.</p><p><b>Stray observations:</b></p><ul><li>Of all the great little gags in this episode, my favorite has to be the visual gag that can be spotted in the image up top. <i>Of course </i>Rigby would misspell his own name on his lunch bag.</li><li>Apologies this review made it up so late—among other things, there were some serious audio issues with tonight’s broadcast, at least for me. Did anyone else have similar problems?</li><li>I didn’t even mention it, but the entire sequence in which Rigby and Mordecai were trapped together in the portable toilet was very funny. Rigby’s insistence that Mordecai should never have eaten the sandwich and instead saved it in case they ended up in this precise situation was a particularly hilarious moment.</li></ul></div>]]>

Dumb and gratuitously unpleasant and <i>vaingloriously</i> half-assed, as if it thinks it’s doing the viewer a favor by not bothering to wrap its gruesome little conceits in any degree of style or wit or imagination or even logical plausibility, because if this stuff were involving and entertaining, if it induced the viewer to give a rat’s ass about what was going on, it would be so epic and awesome we probably couldn’t <i>deal</i> with it. The show’s mediocrity didn’t make it seem like such a menace just a few months ago, but goddammit, now <i><a href="http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/tvshow/the-following,411/">The Following</a></i> is back, and before you know it, you won’t be able to swing a dead cat on TV without hitting a lame, insultingly dopey serial killer show with an overqualified, slumming leading man. It’s getting to be a cultural plague, like that month of so when every network had a show about a guy who went back in time and woke up in high school.</p>
<p>In the climax of tonight’s episode, Lizzie Keen finds herself in a big room full of women in hospital beds who’ve been abducted, put into medically induced comas, and impregnated, so that the babies can be sold into adoption. If you’re going to go that far out where the buses don’t run for your weekly trip into the heart of darkness, you ought to make it count for something, but the show has so little weight and veracity that it’s not scary or horrific or creepy or anything. And don’t even suggest that maybe something about the show could be fun. The only way to have any fun with this show is to start hitting the freeze-frame control on your remote at random intervals whenever Megan Boone is onscreen, to see what happens to her perfect, shiny round pancake of a face. Look, suddenly she’s a porpoise! Wait, now she’s Dondhi! Hold on, now she’s the “Planet Hillary” image stretched out of shape after copying it with Silly Putty!</p>
<p>This week, Red directs Lizzie’s focus to the Cyprus Agency, the evil adoption agency headed by Campbell Scott, who plays his part with the same methodical, glum blandness that even good actors seem to be required to summon up for this show’s Big Bad roles. (Lest you thought that maintaining a baby farm staffed with kidnapped women is a day at the beach, Red points out that “Moving stolen children is difficult. <i>Copious</i> amounts of paperwork.”) Seriously, if they find their lives so joyless and their rows so hard to hoe, why don’t they all cut deals with the federal government and start putting all their old enemies away? That’s what Red is doing, and he’s the only person on this show who ever acts as if he’s having any fun. The act is unconvincing; James Spader grins and tosses off his wisecracks as if he were trying to convince a court-ordered psychiatrist not to increase his dosage of antidepressants.</p>
<p>The one hopeful sign in this performance is that Red, who so often just seems to be going through the motions, does act as if he really enjoys shooting people. I would regain a lot of the respect I once had for Spader if I knew for sure that he revs himself up for these scenes by pretending he’s playing them with the agent who talked him into signing on for this. Tonight, in the last new episode that will be seen until after the Winter Olympics, he does what he can to keep the viewership on the edge of its seat for a month by breaking into Jane Alexander’s house, rudely telling her, “Sit your ass down,” and then emptying a gun into her, apparently because she stole his Gordon Lightfoot album.</p>
<p>Red has killed two birds with one stone by choosing this moment to sic her on the Cyprus Agency. After what she’s seen, she herself no longer has baby fever, and she abandons her plans to adopt a baby with the husband who Red wants her to dump, or at least distrust. Campbell Scott himself is an orphan who was once adopted and then “returned, like a defective toy,” by his foster parents, who could just tell there was… something wrong with him. Proving them right, he’s since devoted his sociopath’s ruthlessness to take revenge on the world by breeding his “perfect” babies, impregnating the captive women himself—a reveal that is supposed to elicit “Ooooooh!”s from the viewing audience, like the moment when it becomes clear why all the Boys from Brazil part their hair that way. I guess somebody thought that adoption agencies have it too easy in this world, so <i>The Blacklist</i> is doing its part to, as Red would put it, disseminate paranoid fantasies that will help exploit and pervert people’s natural inclination to think that any kid that’s not of their blood who sometimes acts in ways they don’t understand is the second coming of Caligula. Not that I would care about that in the least if <em>The</em> <i>Blacklist</i>’s reckless, dark fantasies were in any way<em> fun to watch</em>. But we’ve covered that already.</p></div>]]>

Featuring hilarious voice work from Rainn Wilson as Rattleballs, dynamic action sequences, and a story that expands on Ooo mythology, it’s an episode that delivers on multiple levels, but most importantly, it uses the new cast member to expand Finn and PB’s characters. In his role as sensei, Rattleballs teaches Finn how to direct his overflowing energy into something positive, and the gumball machine’s work ultimately brings him face-to-face with his creator, exposing more sins from PB’s past while giving her the opportunity to redeem herself in the present.</p>
<p>After last week’s episode, Finn has a new sword and a revitalized drive to protect and serve the Candy Kingdom, no matter whom he irritates in the process. PB has to suffer the brunt of this, but eventually, she catches on that she can demand Finn leave her alone by using the power of Princess’ Orders, so she sends him away to relax. He heads out to the junkyard, where he acts out little scenes of himself and PB using pieces of garbage, but the little plays nearly cost him his life when a piece of falling automotive debris almost crushes him. His life is saved by Rattleballs, who chops the car in half and immediately makes himself Finn’s new favorite person by showing some sweet sword moves. Finn wants to learn from this mysterious gumball machine, and despite an initial rejection, Rattleballs eventually buckles because Finn won’t leave otherwise.</p>
<p>Training is an integral part of the hero’s journey, and now that Finn has a fantastic new weapon, he needs to learn how to use it. Rattleballs’ teaching session takes the form of three lessons: learning how to block eggs, running through an obstacle course, and sitting on a mini BBQ full of hot coals. Once Finn makes his way through those challenges, he can learn the shadowless thrust, giving him the ability to cut with such precision that he eliminates all wind resistance for a super quick strike. Finn is going to be much more proficient in battle now, but he still has a while to go before he’s a master swordsman. (In another bit of Finn’s robot arm foreshadowing, Rattleballs tells Finn that he’ll be a master if he trains this hard every day. For 10 years. And gets a robot body.)</p>
<p>After Finn’s training is complete, he learns about the events that led to Rattleballs’ current junkyard situation, revealing a new piece of Candy Kingdom history that paints PB in a very negative light. Rattleballs was part of an elite police force of gumball machine robots created to protect the Candy Kingdom after the Banana Guard proved to be hopelessly inefficient, but those new soldiers were too good at their jobs, eliminating threats permanently and without prejudice. With the kingdom free of crime, some of the Gumball Guard officers became vagrants while others rallied around a shared love of violence, creating a secret wrestling subculture where they could act on their aggression. Eventually, PB discovered their underground activity and decided to decommission the Gumball Guard once and for all, crushing all of them into small black blocks that lived on as minimalist furniture. Only Rattleballs escaped, saved by a sudden glitch in his programming that gave him free will.</p>
<p>Finn’s duty to his princess means that he has to tell PB that Rattleballs is alive, even if he promised his teacher that he wouldn’t, and when PB and the Banana Guard show up at the junkyard, Rattleballs is forced to fight for his survival. The direction for the fight sequences in this episode is really sharp, making Rattleballs look especially badass in action, a character quality that nicely contrasts with his monotone, nonthreatening voice. In general, the animation in this episode is very slick and detailed, with direction that emphasizes the scope of the story. This episode feels big, largely in part because of the meticulous, sprawling backgrounds, and the ending gives the impression that things are only going to expand.</p>
<p>Rattleballs quickly wipes out the Banana Guard, but only injures them, showing PB that he’s more than just a killing machine. She has the opportunity to make up for the unjust deaths of Rattleballs’ brethren by sparing him, and she takes it, making Rattleballs the Candy Kingdom’s protector against the shadows, working with Finn to eliminate future threats from the darkness. It’s nice to see PB’s character finally move closer to karmic balance by doing a good deed this week to counteract all the bad she’s guilty of, and hopefully, this isn’t the last we’ve seen of Rattleballs. With Finn gaining the Grass Sword and a powerful new ally, it seems like <i>Adventure Time </i>is building to something big, but it’s impossible to predict what will happen on this series. “Rattleballs” does great work building a sense of foreboding for that mysterious future event, building on the momentum of last week’s episode as Finn continues to hone his abilities in preparation for what’s to come.</p>
<p><b>Stray observations: </b></p>
<ul><li>Why isn’t Jake in this episode? “Jake said I was acting bananas about the whole thing and wanted no part of this.” Got it.</li>
<li>Princess Bubblegum is totally dressed like Endor Princess Leia in <i>Return Of The Jedi </i>during the flashback sequence.</li>
<li>Captain Root Beer Guy is sticking around and that is awesome.</li>
<li>“I don’t eat muffins. I am a robot.”</li>
<li>“I have found peace in meditation, gardening, egg throwing.”</li>
<li>“Thank you, princess. That’s marginally better than hiding in a dump.”</li>

For decades—centuries, even—people have told stories about magical concoctions that will win the hearts of the woman or man of their dreams, and the patina of fantasy (or an inability to grasp the finer points of individual rights) always makes it sound sort of romantic and sappy, even if the effort is doomed to fail.

                <![CDATA[<img src=http://i.onionstatic.com/avclub/4443/15/16x9/565.jpg /><div><p>Love potions are gross. For decades—centuries, even—people have told stories about magical concoctions that will win the hearts of the woman or man of their dreams, and the patina of fantasy (or an inability to grasp the finer points of individual rights) always makes it sound sort of romantic and sappy, even if the effort is doomed to fail. Besides, most everyone has been there; even if (hopefully) we haven’t tried to dose the object of our unrequited affections, the desire to want someone who doesn’t want you back is pretty universal. Infatuation makes it harder to see where certain lines are, and the idea that there might be some simple solution that would circumvent all the terrifying, tedious steps of flirtation, conversation, risk, and the ever-present fear of rejection, is mighty tempting. But still: love potions are gross. As Rick points out near the end of “Rick Potion #9,” they’re just roofies with a different name. You aren’t trying to build a relationship with a person you care about, you’re trying to cheat-code your way through their subconscious and turn an individual with agency and personality into an object programmed for fucking. The punchline isn’t that it doesn’t work out; the punchline is that you were a big enough ass to think it could work at all.</p>
<p>In Morty’s defense, he is just a kid, and teenagers don’t tend to have the best sense of perspective when it comes to putting the rights of others ahead of their own throbbing biological urges. And when he demands Rick help him out in his pursuit of Jessica, he has, from a certain perspective, a bit of a point; while the specific request is creepy and gross, Rick has asked a lot out of Morty in the past, and Morty hasn’t had all that much to show for it, apart from still being alive and everything. “Rick Potion #9” is another episode where the story hinges on a family member asking Rick for help, and that help going fantastically awry. It’s a fertile ground for plot, because both the request, and the inevitably horrible result, make sense. There’s a reason “The Monkey’s Paw” is a story that keeps getting retold, and it’s not just because we like gusts of wind that might have been zombies. The promise of a quick fix to our problems is such a powerful lure that the consequences don’t really enter into the decision making process. Morty asks Rick if there’s any potential side effects from the potion, because he’s not a complete idiot; yet if he was thinking clearly at all he’d realize that of <em>course</em> there will be side effects, whatever Rick says. (In this case it’s a “No,” followed by an unheard, “Unless she has the flu.”) But the moment before you make the wish, or grab the potion, or use the mad science that will ultimately lead to the downfall of civilization as we know it, you don’t really care.</p>
<p>The episode starts off on the slow side, if only because it’s initial concerns are so mundane. There’s a school dance coming up, and Morty wants to ask Jessica (even though she’s going out with Brad, the football guy), but he knows he doesn’t have a shot; and Jerry is once again insecure about his marriage. This goes on for a bit, with Rick offering his typically jaded perspective on things (love is “a chemical reaction that causes animals to breed,” and Jerry’s marriage is doomed), and it feels a bit like old ground. Even the love potion is initially sort of a shrug. The fact that it works too well, turning Jessica into a crazed, Morty-obsessed lunatic, is expected, and the way her flu allows her to infect others with the craze, leading almost immediately to an entire school full of Morty-lusting lunatics, is fun, but not as clever as the show has proven itself in the past. The <em><a href="http://www.avclub.com/article/10-episodes-that-show-how-ibuffy-the-vampire-slaye-89781">Buffy The Vampire Slayer</a></em> episode “Bewitched, Bothered And Bewildered” had a similar premise, and while that show used magic instead of animal pheromones, the end result, at least initially, is the same: boy does it suck when everyone wants to fuck you.</p>
<p>Thankfully things get weirder as they go, with Rick trying various solutions that only make things much, much worse. First he creates a planet full of Praying-Mantis/Human hybrids who are still obsessed with Marty, but now want to screw him and then kill him; then he creates a planet full of Cronenberg-type (i.e. hideously deformed, à la Jeff Goldblum in <em>The Fly</em>) monsters that, well, the basic root problem doesn’t go away. The best episodes of <em>Rick And Morty</em> combine sharp, logical plotting with biting humor, so that the jokes develop out of the situation and become funnier in context of the very real stakes. “Rick Potion #9,” while far from bad, doesn’t have that kind of furious rhythm to it, and it’s best moments stand in isolation.</p>
<p>The ending reinforces that sense, albeit in a brilliant, unexpected way. Rick’s made such a mess of things (and, to be fair, Morty never should’ve asked for the potion in the first place; remember that next time, kids, when your hormones entice you to exploit the genius of others) that the only way to save the day is to, well, not. Rick finds a parallel universe in which Another Rick and Another Morty somehow figure out a cure to the crisis; only when they get home after having saved the world to finally finish work on the machine Rick was working on at the start of the episode, it explodes, killing them both, allowing our Rick and Morty to take their place. It’s dark, and the montage at the end of our Rick and Morty burying the bodies of their duplicate corpses is appropriately eerie and funny in its eeriness. But as resolutions go, while it’s effectively unexpected and satisfyingly unpleasant, it’s also completely unconnected to the rest of the story; Rick’s meta comment about how they can only do this sort of thing again “four, five times tops” is the writers acknowledging that this is kind of a cheat. It works because it’s weird, and because we get a glimpse of the “old” universe with Jerry having turned into a badass road warrior type. The credit stinger of the Cronenberged Rick and Morty winding up in our Rick and Morty’s old place is also pretty great, as it’s the kind of thinking-through-a-concept that the show does so well. Overall, the episode was fine, just not quite inspired. There are worse things to be.</p>
<p><strong>Stray observations:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Another week, another subplot about Jerry feeling inadequate. At least this time he got to turn into the road warrior for some reason. Some of the Jerry plots have worked out fine, but the show really needs to start developing the rest of its cast; the joke of “wow, he really is pathetic!” could use a rest for a few weeks.</li>
<li>I was a little worried how the episode would handle a plot focusing on Morty’s crush, if only because of earlier stories in which the kid’s sexual needs felt weirdly wish-fulfillment-y, but it was fine. Jessica isn’t really a person or anything, but the bit where she aggressively starts rubbing herself all over Morty goes from “Aw yeah” to “Oh dear god” almost immediately. It’s such an effective deconstruction of the short-sightedness of Morty’s goals that it doesn’t feel exploitive in the least.</li>
<li>“Principal Vagina here. Don’t let the name fool you, I’m very much in charge.”</li>
<li>“You want good words? Date a languager.” -Brad</li>
<li>“Careful, Dad. Jealousy turns women off.” “Isn’t that convenient.”</li>
<li>“You’re not gonna believe this because it usually never happens but I made a mistake.” -Rick</li>
<li>“Okay, sometimes science is more art than science.” -Rick</li>
<li>“I’m Mr. Crowbar. And this is my friend who is also a crowbar.” -Jerry</li>
<li>“I wish that shotgun was my penis.” “If it was, you could call me Ernest Hemingway.” “I don’t get that, and I don’t need to.” -Jerry and Beth, the Nick and Nora of our time.</li>

                <![CDATA[<img src=http://i.onionstatic.com/avclub/4442/85/16x9/565.jpg /><div><p>When season five of <i>Archer</i> began, fans of the show and Americans in general had one burning question they needed Adam Reed and company to answer: Who cares about all of these changes? What’s going to happen to <i>Ron Cadillac</i>? And “A Debt Of Honor” answers that question quite readily: Ron is still married to Malory, and he’s dropping by the Tunt mansion from time to time, just to read his paper and lament how boring things are at work. By episode’s end, he’s been shot by the yakuza and carried out of the mansion to the hospital, all the while swearing off his wife’s new life of crime. Is this the end of Ron Cadillac (on the show)? We can only hope not, because I think we all can agree he’s maybe the greatest character in <i>Archer</i> history.</p>
<p>Other than that, “A Debt Of Honor” continues the season’s sidelong slide into outright serialization, following up on the events of last week with aplomb by revealing that the million dollars Archer and Lana retrieved in the last episode turns out to be counterfeit. Archer’s solution to this is to go to the deli and buy a pack of gum, retrieving $99.50 from worthless cash, but as Cyril points out, he’ll have to do that 10,000 times if he expects to recoup the gang’s cash. (And even then, he’ll end up $5,000 short.) What the team needs is a big-ticket item, something that it can buy in one fell swoop with the bad cash, tricking their purchaser and allowing for either resale that will net actual money or some sort of supply run that will give everybody actual ammunition. (Lana doesn’t have any because she used to get it from work. Archer apparently still has a few rounds left, though he wastes several bullets knocking out the yakuza boss’ hearing in the car near episode’s end.) It’s a surprisingly complex plan to cram into a 20-minute episode, and “Honor” shows the strain in places, but it’s mostly another example of how the premise shift has helped the show rejuvenate itself.</p>
<p>This being <i>Archer</i>, it’s only natural that this plan intersects with Pam at one point or another, and everyone’s favorite former HR representative and current cocaine fiend absconds with the money—which everybody just left lying around—and heads off to buy amphetamines from the yakuza, because she needs something to feed her growing addiction. I’ve seen some complaints about Pam’s cocaine addiction being too over the top even for this show. (I think it’s the fact that she eats the cocaine out of giant bags, looking for all the world like Winnie the Pooh eating honey out of a jar.) Pam’s one of my favorite characters on television, so I’m clearly pre-biased in favor of all of this, but I’m deeply enjoying how much the show is delving into this. One of the things I like about Pam is that she’s essentially indestructible, in a way that the series doesn’t really bother playing up too much. (She just sort of <i>is</i>.) This is another fine example of how far Pam can be pushed in the service of a gag and just how little reality matters to her character. I mean, this is already a crazily heightened situation. Why <i>not</i> turn her into a jittery yet still functional mess?</p>
<p>I have to agree somewhat with <a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/archer-vice-a-kiss-while-dying,107104/">Sonia</a>, though, that the season hasn’t yet done a great job of explaining why Lana’s choosing to stay with this band of idiots and yahoos when she almost certainly would have better prospects elsewhere. I know the answer to this is “because there’s no TV show without Lana,” but when Ron opts out of the battle with the yakuza—as much sense as it makes for the Cadillac King—I found myself wondering why Lana was getting involved as well. She’s pregnant, after all, and seems intent on being a good mother to her baby (as you’d expect). Why, exactly, does she remain so attached to her co-workers, as to follow them into pitched gun battles and potentially dangerous situations? It’s not a question the show has explored much as of yet, but, then, it sometimes seems as if the show has lost track of who Lana is outside of someone who plays straight woman for a few seasons now.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this whole premise shift has been weirdly revealing about Sterling Archer himself. He’s always been a man driven by the rampant embrace of whatever new and crazy adventure wanders across his path, and season five has already given him some great ones to throw himself headlong into. Archer’s most notable quality is that he’s an absolute asshole to almost everyone, but season five places this in even sharper relief, because it’s almost examining how living one’s life that way eventually becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. This isn’t, like, a hard-hitting critique of white privilege or anything like that (nor would I want it to be), but it <i>is</i> increasingly a look at how Archer is an asshole because that’s all he knows. That’s both because he learned that at his mother’s side but also because when he’s just a complete jerk, the world tends to give him whatever it is he’s whining about just to shut him up. Archer won just by being born to Malory, and when he gets away with massive criminal enterprise, there’s never really any suspense that he’ll be caught, because it’s just so unusual to imagine such a thing would ever happen. He’s way ahead and doesn’t even know it.</p>
<p>I was watching a TED Talk (shut up; I’m owning my white hipster credentials) about a study at Berkeley that set players up with a game of <i>Monopoly</i>, giving some of them greater amounts of money and property at the game’s start than others, then examining how the ones with the built-in advantages started to get sort of mean to the players without those advantages, by the end of the game even refusing to acknowledge just how much having all that extra cash had helped them out in the early going of the game. There’s a constant desire on all of our parts to act as if the narratives of our own lives are driven strictly by us as the protagonists, while ignoring the massive role that luck (like, say, the luck all of us reading this have from being born into an age with modern technology and medicine) plays in the success or survival of any one of us.</p>
<p>I don’t really think Reed has any of this on his mind when he sits down to write an episode of <i>Archer</i>. He’s not an explicitly political writer, despite tossing in little digs at various figures and causes over the years. What Adam Reed <i>is</i> is a longtime studier of the asshole in his native habitat, of the guy who gets everything he wants and then wants even more. And for as much as I like <i>Archer</i> when it’s about the supporting characters, I like it even more when it’s about Sterling Archer, the guy who acts like probably most of us would act if we were handed that rigged <i>Monopoly</i> game and told to play.</p>
<p>One of the big, cosmic jokes of <i>Archer</i> has always been the title character’s luck. He makes it through astounding shootouts with only his stepfather getting hit, and he fires off a gun in an enclosed space without seeming to seriously damage his hearing beyond some temporary ringing in his ears. In older narratives, he’s the kind of guy who would get punished for being such a jerk, but on <i>Archer</i>, his name is the title of the show. We know he’s going to win, and watching him keep pushing forward, in spite of everything, makes him seem almost weirdly admirable. He’s an antihero, sure, but one who so purely expresses all of the inner asshole qualities we ourselves share. The smartest, subtlest thing about <i>Archer</i> that season five gets right is that it’s, once again, a show about Sterling Archer.</p>
<p><b>Stray observations:</b></p>
<ul><li>If you pay attention to the headlines on Ron’s newspaper, you’ll get some clues as to what’s coming in future episodes. Granted, they’re mostly boring clues that won’t mean very much to you at this point, but on a second time through the episode, I kind of liked having them there.</li>
<li>I’m loving the weird little glimpses we get into the history of Cheryl’s family in this season. The tunnels underneath the Tunt mansion were dug by a crazy uncle who was trying to tap into the Underground Railroad. (He both thought it was an actual underground railroad and wanted to use it to recapture fugitive slaves.)</li>
<li>George Takei returns to voice the yakuza boss. When asked if she shot him, Malory replies, “Oh, who can remember?”</li>
<li>Does the Tunt mansion have an old gymnasium with medicine balls and Indian clubs? Yes. And Woodhouse is currently trapped under one of the former, having to listen to the phone <i>and</i> doorbell ring while he can’t move. (A servant’s worst nightmare!)</li>
<li>In case you were wondering, the corner of 55th and 5th in Manhattan appears to be a Presbyterian church in our reality.</li>
<li>Cheryl’s ideas for a genre-defining country song include a song about a cyborg in a wheelchair who keeps pussyaching about being a cyborg in a wheelchair. I could see that jumping straight to the top of the charts.</li>
<li>I do hope this isn’t the end for Ron. I know many of you find him mystifying and/or boring, but he is the light of my life, metaphorically speaking. </li>

The end of last season wrapped up with the show immersed in a few decidedly “bigger” threads, and while they were told well, it always felt a bit like an awkward fit; like the show could have been doing more simply by doing less. Three episodes into the third season and everything feels as if it’s in balance again, with smaller character stories again taking center stage.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">These smaller stories are working especially well right now because they all feel emotionally connected. Kathryn’s struggle with feeling lost as her children grow up is accentuated in her strongly negative reaction to Toby’s decision to move out and make his own decisions. John’s struggle to understand his wife’s difficulties color how he is reacting to Daphne’s indiscretions. Daphne’s struggles with Sharee make her much less patient when confronted with John’s continued refusal to forgive her. Everything happening to the Kennish family feels like it is of one organism, living and breathing and contracting and expanding together, reacting to connected internal and external forces. This is my favorite flavor of family drama, and for the most part it plays out splendidly in this episode.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The biggest and most emotionally affecting story of the episode revolves around Daphne and her desperation to regain John’s approval. It manifests itself with her frantically trying to make something of the field hockey team’s first game in order to impress him with their progress and show just how much she’s turned her life around. This involves picking up Sharee at school and generally playing very, very nice with her, trying her hardest to get the best player on her  her side before the big day. Everything goes to hell when the tire-slashing escalates to window-smashing, and Carlton takes action by doing locker searches to find the culprit, finding a box cutter in Sharee’s locker in the process and expelling her.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The locker search scene was an interesting one, because of how deliberately racially charged it was. From the framing, it looked like the only people’s lockers being searched were the new hearing kids, and the school went through the search process by lining them all up against the wall like they were in a police lineup. It was infuriating, but that was the point: Matthew was slashing tires and smashing windows specifically to cause scenes like this, to place doubt in the minds of the administration about what these new kids were doing to Carlton, and it worked. It was a deliberately uncomfortable sight. We know the truth of what’s going on, but other than the handful of Carlton kids in on Matthew’s deeds—at this point, just Emmett and Travis—this plays like an awful scenario that likely (and unfortunately) happens far more often than it should. Daphne helping Sharee get out of being falsely accused is great, but Sharee’s response is absolutely correct: Daphne is a good person, but she has ulterior motives here with John. To someone in Sharee’s position, having the only person at Carlton be on your side feel like they’re using you can’t feel like a very warm embrace.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">While it feels like Daphne’s story with Sharee is just beginning, her story with John comes to a welcome ending—but not before it completely blows up. John’s having a pretty rough season so far, but as I mentioned previously, at least his anger here feels like a boiling over of so many things going on in his life beyond Daphne, with her on the unfortunate end of his very bad day. Listening to John say such horrible things to Daphne is downright hurtful, but her response seems to shake something loose in his brain and finally make him realize that Daphne is just a human—a human who makes mistakes and who he happens to love. Their reconciliation at the end of the episode is the type of scene <i>Switched At Birth</i> does so very well, and this one is no exception.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Toby also gets a significant story this week, as he decides to move out of his parents’ house so he can start a new, grown-up life on his own. This is the smallest of small stories, but I loved every second of it because Toby so rarely gets the chance to have story space like this. Last season his stories were all hyper-focused on his questionable marriage; now, the marriage done, Toby has to figure out how to be an adult, and that, to me, is far more interesting. Him deciding to strike out on his own without Kathryn’s help (in a neighborhood she doesn’t approve of) feels like exactly what he needs to do, and her reaction to it in light of everything happening in her own life is perfectly pitched. Also, Toby the field hockey coach is working like gangbusters for me. Everything’s coming up Toby!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But of all the things that happened in “Fountain,” perhaps my favorite was that Emmett had a significant story again. Emmett is a wonderful character whose screen time was greatly reduced last season, and well, I simply missed him. Watching him wrestle with the appropriate thing to do after learning Matthew was the one slashing tires at Carlton wasn’t an overly complex story (there was really no doubt Emmett would eventually do the right thing), but it did give the show the opportunity to explore the general feeling at Carlton from the deaf community about what Matthew did. Emmett is immediately conflicted, torn between wanting to stand by Matthew’s (likely wrongheaded) assertion that he’s doing it to defend deaf culture and knowing Matthew is doing much more harm than good, while Travis is much more accepting and even pressures Emmett not to turn on his own friend. The only disappointment in this story was not getting a scene between Emmett and Melody as he explains what is happening and asks for advice, but his scene with Daphne was a fine substitute.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Even though the mystery of the Carlton vandal has been solved, between Sharee’s reaction to Daphne and what we saw of the locker search lineup, it feels like the tensions between the hearing and deaf kids might just be beginning. <i>Switched At Birth</i> is telling a lot of small stories right now, but the Carlton story is big, much bigger than the show has even touched on yet, and this is one big story I am looking forward to seeing what happens next.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Stray observations:</b></p>
<ul><li><b>Carrie Wikis Some Art:</b> <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_(Duchamp)" target="_blank">Fountain</a></i>, Marcel Duchamp, 1917. One of the most historically interesting works selected to be an episode title, and it also is special because the actual piece is referenced within the episode.</li>
<li>I continue to enjoy Bay’s time with her art teacher and Tank, simply because of all of Bay’s extraneous stories this one feels the most germane to her character. Watching her explore what future life as an artist might be like informs her character while still remaining entertaining, in a nice, low-key way. Also, Tank is just a very pleasant presence on the show.</li>
<li>How wonderful was it to see Emmett and Daphne as friends again? I do miss the days when they interacted in almost every episode.</li>
<li>I have no idea what to think about Regina’s new insane boss. Working for someone who screams at you is highly overrated, Regina. Ask anyone who’s ever been an assistant in Hollywood. (Also, it feels like they’re going to make out? Regina, please make good choices.)</li>

                <p>One of the reasons I continue to cling to the multi-camera sitcom as a viable form of artistic expression is the presence of the live studio audience. I’ll admit that in the past decade or so, the audience has primarily been understood by too many multi-cams as “the people who laugh,” but increasingly, in the last two or three years, shows are starting to get a better sense of how the audience can be used as a sort of invisible character on the show. And there are few shows handling that idea better than <i>Mom</i> right now. Think, for instance, of the scene where Bonnie chews out Alvin for abandoning her shortly after Christy’s birth. There’s not a joke anywhere in what Bonnie says, but such is the force of Allison Janney’s performance that the audience <i>doesn’t know what to do</i>. You can hear that ...</p>

                <![CDATA[<img src=http://i.onionstatic.com/avclub/4441/61/16x9/565.jpg /><div><p>One of the reasons I continue to cling to the multi-camera sitcom as a viable form of artistic expression is the presence of the live studio audience. I’ll admit that in the past decade or so, the audience has primarily been understood by too many multi-cams as “the people who laugh,” but increasingly, in the last two or three years, shows are starting to get a better sense of how the audience can be used as a sort of invisible character on the show. And there are few shows handling that idea better than <i>Mom</i> right now. Think, for instance, of the scene where Bonnie chews out Alvin for abandoning her shortly after Christy’s birth. There’s not a joke anywhere in what Bonnie says, but such is the force of Allison Janney’s performance that the audience <i>doesn’t know what to do</i>. You can hear that reaction change in ripples. Some of the audience members laugh. Some of them let out something like an “ooh.” Some of them seem perched on the edge of applause. The reaction shifts and morphs and evolves, never settling, always adding necessary texture to an emotionally fraught moment.</p>
<p>“Fireballs And Bullet Holes” isn’t as good as <a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/leather-cribs-and-a-medieval-rack,107116/">last week’s episode</a>—which I think I liked a little more than Gwen did—but it’s still a good example of how the show’s seeming ongoing evolution in the direction of Christy’s home life and the downplay of her work life has been an overall positive for the show. There are things I like about the restaurant world, chiefly French Stewart’s performance, but the material around Christy and her mother is so much more powerful than anything over at the restaurant that the rest of the show can’t escape its gravity. The jokes are better. The acting is better. Even Anna Faris seems more engaged in what’s going on over there. It’s a show that seemed like it was going to be one thing getting constantly dragged toward another, in real time.</p>
<p>In a way, that might be the hidden genius of that messy <i>Mom</i> pilot. As you might recall, I outlined a <a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/pilot,103007/">whole bunch of different shows</a> existing within that pilot, but I was somewhat cynical about the series ever evolving toward the stuff I found most interesting. When it did, I was pleasantly surprised, but now, I don’t wonder if that was part of the creators’ plan for the thing. They would set up a bunch of different <i>potential</i> shows, but they’d also stack the deck in terms of where the interest was by putting a lot of the strongest actors and situations over on the home life side of things. To say that CBS would be unlikely to put on a sitcom about recovering addicts dealing with troubled pasts and give it one of the network’s primo timeslots is an understatement. But by putting those elements inside of a more conventional sitcom, then just letting it evolve naturally, the series’ producers were able to pull off a kind of smuggling of a more complicated sitcom onto TV. It’s the sort of thing that would only work with a producer as powerful as Chuck Lorre working steadfastly as co-creator and writer, but, hey, look who’s working on this show.</p>
<p>As mentioned, “Fireballs And Bullet Holes” is a step down from last week’s episode, but in a fairly predictable way. When <i>Mom</i> cast Kevin Pollak as Christy’s dad, there was no way that it was going to have him appear just in the one scene. He was clearly there to fill out some kind of arc, and as Christy decides to go back to Chico and try to become a part of his life again in this episode, the show first seems to be about how hard it is to enter the life of a long-gone parent as an adult and still get to be their kid, before shifting to being about Christy getting to meet her new father and brothers. It’s a good story for Anna Faris, who gets to cry and laugh and yell, all things she’s very adept at. But it’s somehow been an even better one for Allison Janney, who got those great moments last week when the show reaffirmed the strength of teenage single mothers. This week she gets to play Bonnie’s growing certainty that by trying to make Alvin part of her life, Christy is trying to give short shrift to the parent who was actually there for her.</p>
<p>Last week’s episode was the sort of episode I’d love to see <i>Mom</i> do more of in the future, where nothing is resolved at the end but the strength of the bond between mother and daughter. But “Fireballs” is probably truer to life, in a way. Christy was never going to sit back and simply write her dad off as someone she didn’t want in her life. And we all needed to see what would happen once she told him—<span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 18px;">to hear why, exactly, he would abandon a day-old baby on Christmas Eve. (“To be fair,” he tells Christy, “God did the same to Jesus.”) The episode is notable for letting much of this play out without lots of jokes, instead letting the very real emotions these people would be feeling carry the scenes. When Alvin suggests that he doesn’t really want Christy to be part of his life because he doesn’t want his wife and kids to think he was once a bad person, he gets to see that she almost certainly inherited his temper. And we’ve already talked about how Janney seemingly moves heaven and earth when she chews out the man she once loved and later learned was a scumbucket.</span></p>
<p>And that’s where the studio audience actually <i>helps</i> this show, not hinders it. When single-camera comedies drift too far toward dramatic material, they can often run the risk of turning into overly sappy melodramas. There’s nothing wrong with this, but without the constant stream of laughs, it can be tempting to wonder why the programs aren’t just hourlong light dramas. That’s not the case with a multi-camera sitcom, where the very form seems to insist upon a certain setup-punchline script structure. When that’s not present, the show can get so much mileage out of the tension between what the audience—both in the studio and at home—<i>expects</i> to happen and what’s actually happening. <i>Mom</i> has already reached the stage of its life where it’s confident enough to let some of these scenes play out without constant laughter. Let’s see how far it’s willing to push itself.</p>
<p><b>Stray observations:</b></p>
<ul><li>The title of this episode reminds me of my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPEFIlwbJlg">favorite Sarah Harmer song</a>, so I will let you listen to it now.</li>
<li>I usually don’t comment on TV show genetics, but I see no fathomable way that a union of Allison Janney and Kevin Pollak would produce Anna Faris. It just doesn’t make sense. Another TV nitpick: These characters bombing between Napa and Chico seems a little far-fetched, given that it would take two-and-a-half hours in good traffic, and it seems unlikely there would always be good traffic. But that’s probably just California for you. (More realistic might have been if he lived in East Palo Alto or something.)</li>
<li>To be fair, we <i>do</i> drop by the restaurant for all of about a minute in this episode, and Gabriel gets a line. Sorry, Nate Corddry. We thought you’d be a bigger part of the show, too.</li>
<li>Potentially interesting: <i>Mom</i> seems to have a five-person writers’ room, rather than a much larger one. I wonder how the relatively small size of the room is contributing to the show’s evolution.</li>
<li>And with that, we should probably officially retire the “1,200th word” thing, because this is closing in on 1,300. Good on you, <i>Mom</i>. </li>

Pretty please? Just so we can get a full season of James Purefoy attempting what can definitively be called the worst southern accent in the history of entertainment. The show tries to get away with it by having Joe’s ladyfriend (played by Carrie Preston, trashin’ up her <i>True Blood </i>vibe) critique him, but that line was obviously thrown in after writers realized that Purefoy sounded like a Speak-n-Spell reading Mark Twain underwater while attempting to blend in with the natives of Boone County.</p>
<p>I’m going to concentrate on Joe’s little Southern Gothic adventure because A: the rest of this episode was totally horrible and B: it was also totally boring. Joe’s storyline certainly falls into column A, but not so much column B. It’s hard to be bored when you’re doubled over laughing hysterically at everything you see.</p>
<p>So Joe did not die in the fire last year, as we know. He’s also not directing the actions of his cult, which lies dormant after his death (Emma still thinks he’s gone for good). The twins and the French lady are looking to draw their hero out of hiding, but they don’t know him personally. That makes them all the scarier, of course—highlighted by the comparatively dopey demeanor of his original cultists, including Carlos (J.D. Williams), who sure has survived a lot longer than I expected him to. Joe’s followers are lonely souls—tortured about their sexuality, laden with mommy issues, etc.—but these creepy twins and their French consort are a whole other level of creepy. Sure, Frenchy hasn’t really done anything yet, but you just know she’s gonna be the worst one.</p>
<p>Back to Joe. Since not burning up in the house, he’s been lying low with an admirer (Preston) who wrote him letters while he was in the slammer. Rather than join his murder cult, she seeks to repair his soul mostly through the love of the Lord. Whether Joe is ever actually into this is pretty questionable. He does seem to express some remorse about his life—he’s failed as a writer, a husband and a father, he says with some emotion, forgetting to add “cult leader” and “Ryan Hardy killer” to that list. Maybe he does want to turn over a new leaf, just by growing a big bushy beard, living with a prostitute and raising her confused daughter while pretending to be her brother, just back from the war.</p>
<p>Joe’s accent is so comically bad it’s amazing anyone believes him for a second. He should be telling the noble reverend (who happily sits and chats with Joe after sleeping with his supposed sister seconds earlier) that he got smashed in the mouth during the war, because I dunno how else you explain his busted speech patterns. Instead, everything goes more predictably. The rev figures out who Joe is, and gets hit in the head with a shovel and stabbed to death for his trouble. Joe tried to be normal, he tells him, but the reality is, “I am inevitable,” he growls before ecstatically enjoying his first kill in many months.</p>
<p>One whole episode of Joe being “normal!” That’s what we got before he started his season two spree. I have to applaud the show’s economy in moving this thing along. Why waste time not having Joe be part of the action? Just as we knew he didn’t die, we knew he’d kill again, so even if he has a nice adopted daughter now, get a knife in that sucker’s hands. Now, if we could just get him a laptop so he could get to work at the latest novel, that’d be peachy.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in <i>Following</i>-land, Ryan’s niece just figured out that it’s a bad idea to withhold evidence from the FBI. Some might call it a federal offense, even. Why it took her a goddamn year to get here is neither here nor there, folks. As long as she worthlessly protests about her uncle’s insane recklessness to him over the phone, she’s done her due diligence. Ryan refuses to involve the cops <i>even when he traces the address of the subway serial killers</i>. Who have struck again in a brownstone, murdering a husband and wife and arranging them in another sick tableau.</p>
<p>Finally, it all blows up in Ryan’s face, and Mike gets to sure be mad at him and yell at him, which is pretty much all the reprimand Ryan’s going to get, I bet, despite his willful defiance of the law at every turn. Don’t worry, nobody dies (probably) and Ryan gets closer to Connie Nielsen, who will be his love interest this season because Ryan can’t fall for someone if their life isn’t constantly in danger.</p>
<p>One major complaint about the gross killer twins. In this episode, they kill a lady (we’re subjected to some nasty violence as one of the twins hits her and shoves her face into a wall) and then murder her husband. In the episode’s creepiest scene, one dons a Joe mask and walks into the child’s bedroom, finger over his lips. Will <i>The Following </i>actually have the “guts” to kill a kid on network TV, I wondered? No, the kid survives unharmed, which almost offended me more. That this show <i>thinks</i> it has a line to obey means it doesn’t realize how exploitatively the violence already comes off.  I’m not impressed that it didn’t subject me to that further horror. I’m bored, I’m annoyed, and I’m offended. But those are my three most common feelings during a screening of <i>The Following.</i><i> </i></p>
<p><b>#baconbits:</b></p>
<ul><li>Ryan Binged some info on his Surface tablet! The best all-in-one computer for hunting presumed-dead serial killers!</li>
<li>“You don’t call me back, I storm your place. That’s how it works.” This family understands each other.</li>

</span></p><p dir="ltr">Time flies when you’re connecting all the dots, doesn’t it? That felt like the fastest episode of this season, zipping from year to year, incident to incident, clue to clue, in an effort to weave the Mother into Ted’s life from season one, episode one on. It’s hardly a triumph of comedy; with all the marks it has to hit, “How Your Mother Met Me” feels more like a Arthur Murray dance diagram than an episode of television. Yet it’s exactly what we need as we enter this final stretch of the series.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For months—or more—we’ve been waiting to spend time with the Mother. There’s no way we were going to spend as much time with her, or get to know her as well, as we have with Ted and the gang. But we still need to feel like we know her, in order to give our final assent to the premise of the show. We need to agree with Ted that she is the one he’s been waiting for, and trying to turn other women into, and sometimes despairing of ever encountering, for nine years. How it is possible to get us to believe it? Originally, some people suggested that the first time we’d see the Mother would be the first time Ted saw her. But in retrospect, this would have been an awful betrayal of the emotion we’ve been asked to invest in Ted’s quest. With no way to judge whether it was all worth it, we would be in that frustrating position familiar from movies’ fictional genius artists. A character looks at the artwork and exclaims “Extraordinary!”, and we’re supposed to take his word for it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the other hand, it would be too much to ask us to spend a whole series of episodes with the Mother’s arc, abandoning the people with whom we tune in to spend time. (Heck, it was almost disastrous to marginalize just one member of the gang, Marshall, for the first half of the season.) No, what is needed is a clip show of sorts, or maybe the exact inverse of that. We see the moments in between the fateful intersections when the Mother and Ted crossed paths and missed connections—the moments that show why they kept proceeding on parallel tracks. The ones that reveal, long before they meet, whom they will be once life brings them together.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So “How Your Mother Met Me” begins on the same night as the <em>How I Met Your Mother</em> pilot. While Ted is falling for Robin in MacLaren’s on the west side, the Mother is waiting for her true love Max at the other MacLaren’s—and then getting the phone call about the accident. For the next few years, she refuses to socialize (preferring to work on her series of paintings about robots bowling). She even ditches her friend Kelly at the St. Patrick’s Day party (<a href="http://www.avclub.com/review/how-i-met-your-mother-no-tomorrow-12874">“No Tomorrow”</a>) in order to give her cello to “Naked Man” inventor Mitch for his underprivileged orchestra students; in return, he tells her to do whatever it takes to realize her dream of ending poverty. That’s how she ends up in an economics class, explaining to fellow student Cindy that she’s not in the romance market since she’s already had her one winning lottery ticket (and inviting Cindy to become her roommate). After Darren worms his way into her band Superfreakonomics, the Mother initially turns down romantic overtures from Louis, but then decides it’s time to give relationships a chance.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Throughout, we are treated to bits of dialogue and business showing how similar the Mother and Ted already are (she gets why a bar would be called Puzzles; she owns a calligraphy set, a coin collection, and a chainmail corset from the Re<em>nai</em>ssance Faire;  she laughs at his “because it would be shellfish” joke). But it’s in the final act, when the anti-clipshow gives way to the Mother’s motivating emotion and own legacy of heartbreak and doubt, that the episode truly brings the two of them together. When the Mother returns from picking up Marshall and Marvin, Louis is waiting at his Farhampton beach house with a wedding proposal of his own, and the Mother asks Max’s permission to move on. Even though she gets it, she turns Louis down and decamps for the Farhampton Inn, where she gets the room Robin’s mother should have occupied.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And in a beautiful scene, the kind that <em>HIMYM</em> has always managed to find whenever it threatened to get lost in its own mythology, she sits on the balcony, with the ukelele that Max gave her on the night he died, and sings “La Vie En Rose.” This is a scene that takes its time. After the breakneck pace of the dot-connecting in the first two acts, we almost hold our breath while she sings quietly to herself. Everyone in our gang, separated from each other by a fight or by the artificial conventions of the night before a wedding, is seen alone. But Ted is on the next balcony listening—the first of thousands of times he heard the Mother sing that song, we find out, and his all-time favorite.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What really connects the Mother and Ted isn’t driving gloves or a knack for knowing the exact right quirky gift or a weakness for the big romantic gesture. It’s the courage, shaky though it may be at times, to live with the knowledge that what you want most might always be out of your reach. Max is taken away from the Mother by cruel fate, and she’s pretty sure that she doesn’t get another shot at love. Robin is taken away from Ted by Robin’s own choice, and Ted’s tragedy is that he’s not sure whether there’s something more he could have or should have done. Both are at their lowest ebb. They are giving up what they think is their last chance at happiness, for someone else’s benefit, in the name of friendship. If they can just stick out a few more hours, they’ll find each other. The fear that gnaws at me is that Barney’s empty rollaway will lead Ted to lose his determination. Will he be able to carry through as best man, and as Robin’s friend, without heedlessly making it all about him? Or is there still farther down for him to sink?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Stray observations:</strong></p>
<ul><li>So much fun with the title sequences this season. I love how Kelly rushes past Pilot Ted and Pilot Barney and hails a cab over to the other MacLaren’s, where the Mother sits in a booth with her gang and gets her own sequence of party photos.</li>
<li>“Can I tell you an embarrassing story?” Naked Mitch asks the Mother. “Is it this one, taking place right now?” she wonders.</li>
<li>Oh, Darren. The way he bursts into the grandstanding “Well, maybe just one soooooooong!”, after the Mother generously suggest he join Superfreakonomics on stage at their next gig, tells you all you need to know.</li>
<li>And the way Louis is not completely charmed by the Mother’s English muffin song (“One tasty English muffin is what I am/One tasty English muffin with raspberry jam!”) tells you everything you need to know about him. C’mon, dude. What are you, made of stone?</li>
<li>“Bye, Max.” (Sound effect of my heart breaking.)</li>

                <![CDATA[<img src=http://i.onionstatic.com/avclub/4443/67/16x9/565.jpg /><div><p>Episodes that revel in Stan being a jerk are among my least favorite in <i>American Dad</i>’s run. They utilize one of the show’s oldest plot structures, and rarely is anything new or different discovered about how Stan operates. Gradually the show has shifted away from his staunchly conservative political traits, but his social behavior remains frustrating.</p>
<p>Take the opening scene of “Cock Of The Sleepwalk”: There’s no extra layer to Stan giving Francine 20 seconds per month where he pays attention to what she says, but ends up ignoring all requests and poking her boob as a “parting gift.” Francine struggling to get Stan interested in something substantial—she wants to watch <i>The Notebook </i>together, a stale but ubiquitous reference, and asks if her parents can visit—is a good comedic performance. But the situation is patronizingly callous. Stan ignores and belittles his wife because he is an <i>important man</i>, and yet he needs a retainer full of cake to dream of chocolate, a splendid contradiction that only reinforces that Stan is ridiculous. I really wish that joke didn’t sour me on the episode as a whole, but I’m so tired of this knockoff Al Bundy attitude.</p>
<p>It’s lucky then, that all the buildup of Stan’s prototypical misogyny and hypocritical machismo pays off in a clever reversal of <i>Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde</i>. After recording his 100th kill for the CIA—he thought he was on 99, but the agency counted Stan refusing to donate bone marrow to a dying coworker—Stan wakes up covered in cake, with his wife gushing about how nice he was the previous night. In a sleepwalking daze, he adopted a shelter dog and watched <i>The Notebook</i> with Francine (and even cried while doing it). When he consults Dr. Penguin (Roger, who at first is busy picking a parasol to go with his hoopskirt as Madam Buttercup), they discover his fiercely buried conscience is trying to make up for all of Stan’s killing by doing good deeds.</p>
<p>Robert Louis Stevenson’s<i> Strange Case Of</i> <i>Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde</i> posits there is the capability for monstrosity within anyone, buried deep in the psyche. “Cock Of The Sleepwalk” inverts that discovery, and because of Stan’s attitude, the episode is both a comeuppance and a way to get the audience to root for Stan’s conscience to win out. After all, he’s actually doing nice things for a change. He accepts the job of director at an orphanage—he even adopts a child—and helps his family open a soup kitchen in the living room. Stan’s upset, and it’s easy to laugh at and root for his continued misery. A risqué video with Roger, replacing sniper bullets with gummi bears—those are the kinds of things Stan’s Conscience can do to Stan on the road to making sure he doesn’t kill again.</p>
<p>But of course, Stan must emerge victorious somehow. In order to complete a hit on a Belgian terrorist, he fills an IHOP with the orphans, the homeless, and his family, so that when his conscience emerges, he’ll still be forced to kill the guy to protect those he loves. It’s less about seeing the ridiculous length Stan goes to in order to ensure he can kill again, and more of a tacit defense of murder—provided the safety of those you care about is at stake. It’s muddled, since the ending is mostly an extended gag featuring the conscience having to use many different items to beat the terrorist to death.</p>
<p>The subversion, as is the case on many <i>American Dad</i> episodes, is that Stan learns nothing. He doesn’t want to change and simply claims victory over his conscience. That’s the inevitable reset at the end of a sitcom, even one as ludicrous and fanciful as this one, and it’s unsatisfying. Still, seeing Stan so distressed at actually committing good deeds—especially Roger hiding the more explicit part of that video from a sleep-deprived Stan—makes “Cock Of The Sleepwalk” a fun, if frustrating, episode.</p>
<p><b>Stray observations:</b></p>
<ul><li>Avery professes that he’s a responsible, moderate cocaine and opium user. That obviously turns out to be vehemently false.</li>
<li>The fate of Rashes, the dog Stan adopts and then gives to a Korean restaurant, is a great example of how <i>American Dad</i> hints at poor taste, then takes a sharp left turn for the surreal.</li>
<li>“Need I say more?” “Only if you want me to understand.”</li>

</span></p><p dir="ltr">Well, that didn’t take long, did it?</p>
<p dir="ltr">It was clear that at some point Fiona and Mike’s fever-dream courtship would grind to a halt, likely in a spectacular fashion, likely because of a bone-headed move by Fiona. But man, this was set into motion much earlier than I had anticipated, and of all Fiona’s lapses in judgment, the aftershocks of this one are potentially devastating. Fiona’s fib about the origin of the shattered windshield on her company car barely qualifies as a transgression compared to her introduction to Mike’s ne’er-do-well brother Robbie.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Like Father, Like Daughter” played like a 1980s slasher film at quarter speed. It’s clear from the moment Robbie bounds in for a family dinner, all good-time jolly and charmingly apathetic, that he and Fiona are headed for a collision with serious ramifications for her relationship with Mike. So I watched with one eye half-open, hoping Fiona wouldn’t make the idiotic choice that she was naturally going to make. During Robbie and Fiona’s flirtatious chat in Mike’s kitchen, I said aloud “It’s not too late to go home. Just go home.” Of course, Fiona doesn’t go home, but when Robbie abruptly kisses her, she does flee to someplace familiar: the warm embrace of chaos.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Fiona has no other choice than to be the way she is. She’s used to mayhem, stress and an ever-crumbling sky, so she’s been well acclimated to the storm, but not to the calm that precedes it. It could be argued that Fiona’s tryst with Robbie was about creating havoc in a situation where there was none, because those are the only circumstances under which she knows how to thrive. That’s clearly part of it, but the psychology is more complicated than that.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Robbie is the perfect weapon to destroy the faithful Fiona. He’s handsome, charming, and has demons he makes no effort to keep buried. If Fiona was out to sabotage her relationship with Mike, just on a lark, she would have found a way long before now. She wouldn’t have succumbed to just anyone. It’s who Robbie is: He’s sort of proud of his flaws, he could have had it “easy” but chose his own path. Fiona’s attracted to Robbie for many of the same reasons she was drawn to Steve, making him especially enticing to her as she deals with the confusing non-ending of her prior relationship. He was exactly the wrong person for Fiona to meet.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That creepy, menacing final scene between Fiona and Robbie suggests this entanglement is far from over. Too bad, since so much is at stake. Fiona’s job at Worldwide Cup gave rise to this unprecedented harvest for the Gallaghers: medical care, discretionary income, and so on. Now, Fiona’s entire livelihood is in the hands of a man who brags about his lack of regard for others the way most guys his age brag about a basketball play they made in high school.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To be honest, I’m not exactly resisting this development, but there is part of me that feels like it’s a bit off-key for Fiona. Not the impulsiveness of it, or the foolishness of it, which both represent classic Fiona. But Robbie telegraphed his ill intentions so early on, I didn’t completely buy that a girl as socially shrewd and bullshit averse as Fiona wouldn’t catch a whiff of what he was up to as early on as I did. Robbie’s insistence on getting them both drunk, as he maintained his sobriety, was a major red flag. I don’t completely buy that Fiona would allow the situation to unfold the way it did knowing what Robbie’s agenda was. I get that this is the girl who, on two separate occasions, did the damn thing while waiting in a drive-thru line. But Fiona is also fiercely protective of who and what is important to her, and I’d think her instinct would be to steer clear of Patrick once she got a hint of his game and protect her relationship from an obvious interloper.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But maybe Fiona is another addict, like Patrick says. I don’t necessarily buy this, but it’s a fascinating idea for <em>Shameless</em> to explore as Fiona continues ignoring Frank’s plight as his condition worsens. What is an addiction, anyway, other than a pattern of behavior developed over time as a way of dealing with the world? Frank’s selfish behavior destroys the people around him, but there was nothing benign about Fiona’s hook-up with Robbie, either. She’s capable of destroying people too. The final shot of Fiona gazing at Frank teeter on excess, but it’s brief enough a glimpse that it works perfectly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The non-Fiona threads of “Like Father, Like Daughter” also roll out with horror-movie portent, with Frank ingratiating himself to Samantha and Debbie trying in vain to drive Matt “cray.” The Frank stuff with Sammi and weird little Chuck is typical Frank stuff: Frank being a despicable human being, played for comic effect. This time, Frank is trying to romance his daughter into donating her liver to him, an offer she makes with startling speed. (Are shared butterscotch aversions the stuff organ transplants are made of?) Still, I’m a big fan of Emily Bergl and insomuch as one can enjoy a Frank storyline, I’m enjoying this one.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I’m also slowly coming around on the idea of Debbie’s relationship with Matt. Don’t get me wrong, I still think he’s creepy, but I no longer think he’s predatory. Matt actually seems kind of sweet, priding himself on cooking for Debbie and being the one to introduce her to <i><a href="http://www.avclub.com/article/david-lynch-shows-how-audio-can-be-creepier-than-a-73926" target="_self">Eraserhead</a></i>. Matt strikes me as a guy who is way behind the curve where social development is concerned, and Debbie represents a non-threatening female interest in him because she’s so young, not to mention genuinely interested in him. The storyline will be much easier to tolerate now that the specter of statutory rape isn’t hanging over it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sheila is still a bit of a question mark, and it’s beginning to feel like <i>Shameless</i> may have outgrown her. I adore Joan Cusack’s performance, so I certainly hope that isn’t the case, but Sheila’s adventures in online dating aren’t a draw for me.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Stray observations:</strong></p>
<ul><li>I’m digging Nick Gehlfuss as Robbie; he’s exactly right for it.</li>
<li>Very clever title, given the way Sheila Callaghan’s script points at the immediate similarities between Frank and Sammi before hammering home the less obvious parallels between Frank and Fi. </li>
<li>Mickey is so lovesick over Ian, he’ll literally let any ginger do anything to him, anywhere, for any length of time.</li>
<li>Lip’s arc this season is quite sad, as he continues to struggle with his adjustment to college life. The all-nighter only yielded a 77 on his paper. Ouch.</li>
<li>There was another “flash mob freeze” shot, which looked as lovely as it did the first time, but I think it was a one-time gag. Plus, to nitpick, was that a frozen guy on a bike in mid-pedal? That isn’t possible.</li>
</ul>

And we’re all invited to celebrate the charming couple, solve a highly coincidental murder, sit through an overly long best man’s speech, and get amazingly drunk. After a particularly rocky opener in the disconnected and emotionally-throttled “The Empty Hearse,” “The Sign of Three” settles in as the squishy middle of the third season. And while it solidifies this series’ increasingly-meta tone (there’s plenty of fan service here), it also provides breathing room for some welcome beats with its lead characters.</p>
<p>The majority of the episode takes place at the wedding itself, with liberal flashbacks to the pair of seemingly-unrelated cases that, because this is TV, come together at the very height of the festivities. But its best moments are the rare, quiet moments between Sherlock and Watson slipped in among the set pieces and memory callbacks. In particular, this episode gives Watson a moment to step beyond the often-subsumed damsel this iteration of Sherlock has made him: asking Sherlock to be his best man. Quietly confident, stopping short of indulgence but still undoubtedly fond, this is the Watson of Conan Doyle’s stories, who does much better without his best friend than his best friend ever does without him. (At the end of <em>The Sign of Four,</em> the Holmes adventure from which this story takes its title, Sherlock calmly announces that in Watson’s absence, “there still remains the cocaine-bottle.”) Freeman, who shines throughout this episode, is at his best in this little scene at the kitchen table.</p>
<p>He also, as it turns out, plays a pretty great drunk. Their stag-night montage leads to two-man parlor games at 221b in which Freeman is note-perfect, and watching Sherlock slosh his way through an impromptu investigation is more clever meta than anything we got last episode. (Best one’s a toss-up between “I know aaaaash” and “sitty thing.”) The always marvelous Alice Lowe, as a nurse convinced she dated a ghost, gives a hilarious intensity to her plot-device part; you almost wish she’d come to the wedding.</p>
<p>And oh, the wedding. Amanda Abbington continues to enjoy herself immensely as Mary, though her screen time is relegated to tossing out clichés (she lost a lot of weight to fit into her dress, in case we were burning to know that) and matchmaking between this show’s real couple. She gets one intriguing beat—shooting down Sherlock with “I’m not John, I can tell when you’re fibbing”—but it goes without comment. That’s a shame, because it says a lot about her that merits exploring, and it also says a lot about John, none of it super great.</p>
<p>But naturally, the main event in this episode is Sherlock: his reaction to his date (a game Yasmine Akram), his ability to solve a crime in real time in a room of tipsy revelers, and his speech. Cumberbatch does a yeoman’s work, though the speech itself outstays its welcome, and unfortunately, once again, we’re offered Sherlock as an uneasy balance of arch superhuman and floundering man-child.</p>
<p>Not that he’s without his moments—his sincerity with suicidal Major Sholto about sparing Watson any pain on his wedding day almost eclipses the ruin Sherlock’s already made of Watson’s wedding day. But this Sherlock, as written, tends to traffic in aggressive coolness and rudeness, interrupted by bouts of petulant melancholy—an approach that works against any nuances brought up in the interim. While it works as shorthand in a series as limited as this one, it still often misses the mark on his potential complexity and ultimately leaves him feeling slightly static.</p>
<p>Stylewise, we get some admirable flourishes in the flashbacks: Watson’s superbly fleshy blink on waking from his stag-night blackout is great. But its flair is sometimes stylized to the episode’s detriment. Sherlock’s mind-palace interrogation of victims of the Mayfly Man is sharply done (Vicky needs her own show), but coming in the third act of an episode rife with trick cuts, it feels like overkill when it shouldn’t. Less-frenetic editing of Sherlock and Mycroft’s phone call could have gone a long way here. In fact, less of that could have gone a long way, full stop: Mark Gatiss has leveraged himself into significantly more screen time, but being the ever-present taskmaster of Sherlock’s subconscious <em>and</em> his mid-treadmill confidential bestie feels like a bit too much of a character who’s at his best in small, antisocial doses.</p>
<p>Still, the crimes (which dovetail so nicely it’s nearly comic) provide a solid backdrop for the wedding, the whole ensemble comes together in a single scene, and there’s enough real feeling between Sherlock and John to carry the day. Besides, the closing reveal that Mary’s pregnant, and Sherlock’s promise not to make any more vows, can only mean total disaster awaits everyone next episode, so you might as well enjoy this dance party while you can.</p>
<p><b>Stray observations:</b></p>
<ul><li>An observation from last week: There was some consternation that I laid responsibility for the show's overall thematic and characterization shortcomings not with Mark Gatiss, co-creator who received script credit for that episode, but with Steven Moffat, showrunner and public face of the show. A showrunner is often considered a synecdoche for the show in general, particularly for a limited series, for which it’s easier to maintain creative control. I continue to think <a href="http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2014-01-01/sherlock-steven-moffat-interviews-benedict-cumberbatch">a showrunner like Moffat</a> is knee-deep in, and answerable for, any decisions made about this show. As an example, this week splits writing credit among Stephen Thompson, Moffat, and Gatiss, with Moffat <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03pzpgy/live">mentioning to the press</a> that he wrote much of the best man speech that serves as both frame story and centerpiece of the third act.</li>
<li>Mrs. Hudson’s unconscious grief about losing friends in marriage, and her darkly comic views about dear departed Mr. Hudson, give Una Stubbs some lovely moments with Watson. She also gets the runner-up line delivery of the week in response to Sherlock’s questions about whom you’d murder at a wedding: “I think you're a popular choice at the moment.”</li>
<li>“Do you always carry handcuffs?” “Down, girl.” Wow. Thanks, show.</li>
<li>That opener of Lestrade abandoning the case of the year to rush to Sherlock’s call for aid is indicative of one of the show’s least endearing facets. Lestrade’s later visit to Molly to discuss the toast is even worse—not only does this universe forgive Sherlock everything, but what percentage of everybody’s day is spent talking about him? It’s entirely possible to make a Sherlock Holmes adaptation in which there are times Holmes is merely tolerated by those around him. This iteration continues to play for laughs what feel increasingly like low-level hostage situations.</li>
<li>“This blog is the story of two men and their frankly ridiculous adventures.” If this gets any more meta, next season’s going to be entirely compiled of webcam reaction footage to this season.</li>
<li>Speaking of: “There are two people who have done that, and the other one is... a complete dickhead.” See also: “You’re a drama queen.” Don’t worry, this is <i>Sherlock</i>; no one will ever hold him to it.</li>
<li>Line delivery of the week: Freeman’s “Of course you are.”</li>
<li>I’d be interested in a monograph on the forensic applications of postmortem roasting of the optic nerve.</li>
<li>Geothe, quoted in <em>The Sign of Four</em>: “Schade, dass die Natur  nur einen Mensch aus dir schuf, denn zum würdigen Mann war und zum  Schelmen der Stoff.” [Alas, that Nature made only one man of you, when  there was material enough for a good man and a rogue.]</li>

                <p>Sitcom plots often exist solely to service fake emotional beats which don’t ever come back—say a character gets a new, cool friend only so she can realize that her reliable, old, lame friend was the better friend the whole time.

                <![CDATA[<img src=http://i.onionstatic.com/avclub/4443/66/16x9/565.jpg /><div><p>Sitcom plots often exist solely to service fake emotional beats which don’t ever come back—say a character gets a new, cool friend only so she can realize that her reliable, old, lame friend was the better friend the whole time. It can be a little distracting when there are radically new things introduced into a pre-existing sitcom structure solely to drill in some banal, “heartfelt” message, which is why the fake episode of <i><a href="http://www.avclub.com/review/the-love-boat-season-one-volume-one-7200">The Love Boat</a></i> in tonight’s <i>Family Guy</i> (in which a pirate crew comes on board to rekindle a dying marriage) is one of the funniest parts of the episode, but also calls attention to the faults of “Brian’s A Bad Father.” <i>The Love Boat </i>is a particularly good show to illustrate this facet of reset-heavy sitcom storytelling, with its focus on the self-contained stories of guest stars. But the example also calls attention to the way that sort of storytelling works best with one-off characters. “Brian’s A Bad Father,” which does the same thing but in the service of a pre-existing character, just collapses.</p>
<p>The bulk of tonight’s episode focuses on Brian being, well, a terrible father. We’re reminded that he has a son named Dylan from way back in the day (introduced in season six’s “The Former Life Of Brian”), and further, that Brian has been extremely neglectful. Of course, that’s not quite the case, since at the end of that episode Brian offers to be an attentive, present father and Dylan chooses to take care of his mother, but <i>Family Guy</i> seems happy enough to sweep that under the rug. Here, Brian tries to sleazily avoid Dylan until he discovers that his son is acting on a TV show, at which point he rushes out the door to try to get a writing job. Part of the joke of Brian has always been the juxtaposition of his professed liberal “compassion” and the same selfishness that drives everyone else, but the speed with which he goes to exploit his son still seems a bit off, somehow. Beyond that exploitation, Brian acts like a pretentious windbag on the job (of course) before getting fired. On his way out, he takes a large amount of free food from the craft services table as well as a whole case of Diet Coke (in the best gag of the episode) before stuffing the whole table in his douchey Prius. Brian’s horribleness comes across as just painful, more <i><a href="http://www.avclub.com/tv/eastbound-down/" target="_blank">Eastbound And Down</a></i> than even <i><a href="http://www.avclub.com/tv/its-always-sunny-in-philadelphia/" target="_blank">It’s Always Sunny</a></i>. </p>
<p>Other aspects of Brian’s character are also a little off. His terrible writing used to be one of the character’s best sources of humor. The ridiculous, gruesome, after-school special quality of Brian’s writing (there’s an abdomen0punch abortion) and the way he lets himself stop working after having one stupid idea at the beginning of the episode are decent enough, but they don’t quite congeal into the perfection of the early-season digs at Brian’s perpetually unfinished novel. Eventually, Brian tries to redeem himself, feeling terrible about what he did to Dylan. Stewie calls attention to how much of a bad person he is, but he goes through the motions of convincing Dylan to take him back anyway—not that Dylan is ever going to show up on <i>Family Guy</i> again (probably). When so much of the episode is based on moving Brian from one end of the parenting spectrum to the other, that story has to be compelling. But because it’s hard to buy Brian at the beginning, it’s difficult to watch this episode or take it that seriously (or as seriously as you’d ever take an episode of <i>Family Guy</i>).</p>
<p><i>Family Guy</i> has always been a mean-spirited show—the characters mostly serve as cutouts to set up an endless series of jokes—so the trappings of sitcom beats work even less than they do in other shows, where’s there’s at least slightly more of a stab at continuity. <i>Family Guy</i> laughs in the face of that sort of long-term storytelling—that’s especially true in this episode, which makes several references to how long the show has been on and the age of the audience—so its attempts at getting anyone to care about Brian’s “redemptive” arc even more pointless. That’s especially odd because over in the B-plot, Peter and Quagmire act, weirdly, like real people. Peter accidentally shoots Quagmire on a hunting trip and the two get into a huge fight in which they end up splitting all their friend assets, divorce-style. This story isn’t so funny, but it at least hangs together reasonably well—mostly playing on the aggressively rational, uptight Quagmire, who usually only shows up when he’s angry with Brian. Though, I guess it ends with Quagmire shooting Peter in the face, so there’s only so much realism we can ask for on this show.</p>
<p><b>Stray observations:</b></p>
<ul><li>Unofficial cutaway counter: eight.</li>
<li>“You’re the worst. Welcome aboard.”</li>
<li>As weirdly flat as Brian’s story was here, it wasn’t half as flat as most of the Grammys (ba-zing!). </li>

                <![CDATA[<img src=http://i.onionstatic.com/avclub/4441/14/16x9/565.jpg /><div><p>When the thinkpiece-industrial complex rolled out its multi-part whine of boredom last week, I imagine “Looking For Uncut” is what critics had in mind. Patrick goes on another awkward date, Dom accidentally ingests some backstory, and Agustín hangs a painting. In the high-stakes world of TV criticism, clearly it takes something flashier to make an impression. But just because <i>Looking</i> is understated doesn’t mean it has nothing to say. It just means, like Patrick Googling “uncut Latin cock,” you have to look closer.</p>
<p>Andrew Haigh directed and wrote “Looking For Uncut,” and it’s telling that those are the first two credits at the end, in that order, ahead of the title card and the creator. <i>Looking</i> certainly has its writerly moments, but the dialogue strives to sound unwritten, not in the “um, uh” Jason Katims sense but light on polish nonetheless. What’s more expressive are the performances and the camera. Take that great shot of Patrick and Richie dancing to Erasure. To that point, the date has basically been an airing of Patrick’s assumptions about class and race: He’s surprised Richie dressed up for their date, he’s fascinated with Richie’s Catholic chain and his big, international family. Most of all, though he manages to keep a lid on this one, he’s curious whether Richie’s uncircumcised or not. Yes, Patrick has gone 29 years without beholding an uncut Latin cock, and it’s all he can think about once Agustín brings it up. And Patrick wonders why his friends act like he’s fresh off the bus. At least he’s aware enough to be embarrassed, but drowning himself in alcohol only makes him sloppier. By the time they’re ready to go, Richie tables Patrick’s offer to go back to his place, suggesting they go somewhere else first. How rare to see a cringe comedy that doesn’t announce itself. After all, understatement is the name of the game. At the club, it’s still hard to get a firm handle on Richie. What is clear is that Patrick is totally out of sync with the guy, yammering on about maybe blowing him in the bathroom if he wants, just kidding, let’s do shots.</p>
<p>Then comes “A Little Respect.” It’s halfway through the song when we drop back in on Patrick and Richie on the dance floor, but the club is so dark that the focal point is the white shirt smack in the middle of the frame. He’s practically making out with his partner. It takes a second to realize that they aren’t Patrick and Richie. Worse yet, they’re visible in the vast space between Patrick and Richie. The contrast speaks volumes. Patrick’s flailing, not exactly with the beat. Richie’s practically unreadable—head down, face unlit, back angled slightly toward the camera—which speaks for itself. And then comes this transformative 45-second dolly in on them through the crowd, eye-level for maximum immersion. Most of the time they’re silhouettes, but about halfway through the light hits them at the perfect moment: Patrick’s bouncing with his hands on Richie’s shoulders, singing the song to him, and Richie can’t help but laugh. By now we’re close enough to see that Richie’s really getting into the song himself, and when he dons his trying-to-have-a-moment face, suddenly it’s palpable. They are having a moment. They go dark again as the camera gets closer to the silhouettes, Andy Bell blaring, “Oh, baby, pleeease!” By the time the lights hit them again, they’re two smiling faces filling the frame, inches apart, moving in sync. Like the climactic smile in <a href="http://www.avclub.com/review/looking-for-now-107068">“Looking For Now,”</a> it’s a huge emotional beat that you’d miss if you weren’t paying attention. This isn’t just people dancing. It’s a turning point.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the next cut brings Richie back to Patrick’s apartment, but he can’t stay long, hint hint, so they go right to the bedroom. Now, Haigh’s <i>Weekend</i> is notable for a money shot on the main character’s stomach that shows what sex is really like, but Haigh’s work is more prone to sexualizing everyday male nudity, like a neck or an armpit. So after the tasteful cut away from the threesome in the premiere, I understand the skepticism about the show’s treatment of sex. This is an episode about a penis that can’t even match up to the male nudity of television’s preeminent breast showcase, <i><a href="http://www.avclub.com/tv/game-of-thrones-newbies/">Game Of Thrones</a></i>. Don’t get me wrong: The second-screen experience that Patrick walks us through is quite edifying, but gay television has been politely behaving itself since before <i>Batman</i>. If <i>Looking</i> is so interested in sex, it might help to show some.</p>
<p>“Looking For Uncut” is at your service. First Dom fucks a Grindr guy from behind standing in front of a mirror. A long shot keeps us in the moment, panning from a profile of Dom’s bare ass up and across their bodies, where it lingers for a bit, and to the mirror to put some safe distance between us and the bottom’s final yawp. They’re impossibly shadowed for mid-afternoon, as if we’re meant to think about something other than Dom’s body, but nevertheless, this is half a minute of panting, moaning, bodies slapping into each other, heads collapsing in unison, and laughing together. How refreshing.</p>
<p>That night, Patrick strips Richie while making out in bed. There’s plenty of kissing up and down Richie’s body, and some comedy when Patrick falls backward: “God, you wear tight jeans. Motherfucker!” Then he peels back Richie’s waistband and says, “Huh.” It could be a big, broad sitcom moment, but the effect of <i>Looking</i>’s restraint is to look closer. In every scene we’re trying to get a read on people. How does Agustín really feel about moving to Oakland? What is Dom’s reaction to the new and improved Ethan? Is Richie seeing the same Patrick I am? Only <i><a href="http://www.avclub.com/tv/mad-men/">Mad Men</a></i> is this opaque, this adept at engaging the audience’s social skills.</p>
<p>Yes, while Patrick spends the day designing characters for his new Kenneth Anger video game, Dom sees Ethan twice and Agustín settles in with Frank. The Ethan story doesn’t take much time, but I already know he’s a tool, so I’m already ready for Dom to move on. Before it even begins I’ve skipped to the end in my head. Good thing there’s a sex scene in the middle. That said, the way every new scene forces us to recalibrate is what <i>Looking</i> is all about.  At first it seems like Dom feels bad about himself for arrested development, then it seems like he was hoping to have sex with Ethan (which results in the Grindr hookup), and finally it turns out Ethan just rekindled his anger. Actually all three are probably true. But the thing about mumblecore-style realism is that there’s no leeway. The second the spell of everyday life is broken, the refusal to stylize looks like careless amateurism. When Dom calls Ethan a meth-head in front of Ethan’s clients, he trails off, an admirable attempt at something human that’s nevertheless an awkward fit for that moment of public rage. Muting everything is no truer to life than anything else.</p>
<p>Yet here I am wondering why Agustín hangs a painting. He claims to hate it in front of Patrick and Dom. Is it because Frank loves it (“It’s a unicorn with a cock inside. It’s fuckin’ awesome”)? Did Frank’s affection help him see the value in his own work? Probably so, at least enough to give into Frank and hang  it anyway, see if it grows on him. He’s also moving in, creating a sense of history in his new environment. Most importantly there’s a sense of resolution in hanging the painting, collapsing the space between who he is and how he thinks of himself. When Frank teases him (“If you want we can just check in someplace cool on Facebook so your city friends know that you’re not dead”), he laughs and moves to cuddle, genuinely happy to stay in. Dom is somewhere in the middle, achieving some one-sided resolution eight years after the fact but not much closer to feeling satisfied. Patrick hasn’t even begun that process. He’s so obsessed with proving he’s someone he’s not that he sabotages himself, and Richie leaves. “I think we’re looking for different things.” The sad thing is they really aren’t. </p>
<p>It’s nice to have so many gay shows to choose from when you need a stick to beat <i>Looking</i> with, but <i>Looking</i> isn’t those other shows. It’s not as funny as <i>Husbands</i>, but it shows more sex. It’s not as flamboyant as <i>Queer As Folk</i>, a sexy soap that does all the work of feeling for you. It’s older than <i>Please Like Me</i> and more together than <i>The Outs</i>. All of these are excellent, but the closest comparison is <i>Treme</i>, HBO’s other niche slice-of-life. Both feature diverse casts, both depend on local flavor, and both are magical when the music’s playing. It’s just that on <i>Looking</i>, the music is Erasure. How’s that for not gay enough?</p>
<p><b>Stray observations:</b></p>
<ul><li>The moving sequence is a welcome look at how the guys interact. When Patrick says, “Who said anything about a boyfriend? Maybe I just wanna get myself a fuck buddy,” I love how Dom pops up into frame. And how Patrick can barely keep a straight face and strategically lowers his voice on “Mexican fuck buddy” when they ask him to say it again.</li>
<li>As Patrick says his goodbyes, Dom says: “Get in the car, Rose.” Which brings up the irresistible subject: Which Golden Girl are Agustín and Dom? I’m thinking Blanche and Sophia but I’m open to argument.</li>
<li>The opening debate about the difference, if there is one, between sex and intimacy is a nice way to plot Patrick and Agustín on a spectrum, but the more revealing filter is the running thread about authenticity, as in what defines the real San Francisco or a real Mexican-American. “He’s become so L.A. He drinks refreshed tea.”</li>
<li>More history: Agustín’s from Florida. Patrick’s maybe from Colorado. And Dom gave Ethan a lot of money to get clean, but Doris still wants to neck-punch him.</li>
<li>Doris gets home while the Grindr guy showers. “Why is he taking a shower? What did you do to him? Am I gonna have to buy Clorox again?”</li>
<li>More of Dom and Doris, please. Him: “I’m such a cliché.” Her: “You mean how you dress?”</li>
<li>The closing phone call between Patrick and Agustín is one more reason to see the guys together more often. “Well, everything was going fine until I acted like all I wanted to do was suck on his uncut cock, which it turns out he doesn’t even actually have. I think I may be a racist as well.”</li>

The show’s too inherently focused on the oddball offspring to ever really be a show about the restaurant, but there’s something to be said for a show that puts a plot about a calculated business risk in an episode that features a scene of Bob arguing with a murderous zucchini.</span><br></p>
<p>Bob’s decision to best Jimmy Pesto’s Super Bowl preparation by airing a zero-budget commercial during the game brings the entire family together in a single plot. That’s always a good time with the Belchers, and probably not unexpected in something that’s essentially a holiday special (mere weeks after the <i>last</i> holiday special). But it also feeds neatly into the barely-hidden exhibitionist streak that runs a mile wide in this family. While the pacing on this show can be frenetic, keeping everyone involved in the same task makes it easier to streamline and build up what’s essentially a single joke into a surprisingly effective episode.</p>
<p>An ensemble episode means less spotlight time for everyone but a chance to enjoy the wider group dynamic, which in <i>Bob’s Burgers</i> has proved itself to be reliably funny. And in the initial version of the commercial, directed by Randy, each Belcher gets a pitch-perfect moment to shine, in which they naturally fail spectacularly: Linda sings; Tina flips her hair so hard she loses her glasses; Gene and his burger costume lay waste to a scale model and shower it with mustard-pee. (Louise, a screenwriter frustrated in her directorial ambition, is too busy wresting power from Randy to act.)</p>
<p>Naturally, Bob tries to scrape the best out of a bad situation by hiring ex-NFL star Sandy “Can Can” Frye as a celebrity endorsement. But when Bob decides to cut his family out of the ad entirely, it brings up an uncomfortable and lingering truth: Bob’s frustrations with his family run deep. His defense of the change with “Sandy’s so great and likable” would be doubly hurtful if anyone in his family had any insecurities. (Instead, everyone just forms a can-can line of family recrimination, because they’re Belchers.) His punishment is, of course, that his commercial gets scooped by Pesto’s own Frye-feature, robbing Bob of his big idea and his potential customers in one fell swoop. When Bob storms over to demand justice, he finds the world an indifferent sea of strangers—until the Belcher clan forgives him enough to come rescue him from projectile meatballs.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Pesto restaurant faceoff includes the B-plot (and I was trying to avoid accidental poop jokes and it’s probably already too late). I’ll admit that I’m never going to be the audience for scat humor, but even given that, I’m not sure how many more fart-and-poop-centric subplots the writers can pin on Gene. Both Louise and Tina have grown as characters—even so far this season—but Gene’s lagging behind, and it’s starting to show. His shameless enthusiasm can hopefully be steered to other things soon, because despite its eventual plot relevance, the Super Bowel just didn’t seem of a piece with the rest of the episode.</p>
<p>Overall, though, this is another solid installment of a great season, with the inherent gimmick of the Super Bowl suitably drowned in the sublimely talentless Belcher charm. And yes, we do get to see the all-family version of the commercial, which is just as great and terrible as you imagine. I hope we see it again.</p>
<p><b>Stray observations:</b></p>
<ul><li>I was excited to sub for Pilot, who’s off filming a Super Bowl commercial, probably. She’ll be back for the next new episode, which will air… sometime in February?<br></li><li>One of the best things about a show that’s found the groove this one has is the internal shorthand the characters have with each other—and that the show has with its audience. The episode’s funniest rapid-fire sequence is Gene muttering “Get it out now” as Randy pulls up, at which point everyone agreeably lets loose with their biggest Randy resentment.</li>
<li>Not a fan of Gene’s gastrointestinal humor as identifying trait, but never has someone made a more impassioned defense of their bowel movements: “I’m their family! I raised them!”</li>
<li>Tina’s unswerving loyalty to her family pops up in the best ways (“I’ve got nothing.” “No, Dad. <i>We</i>’ve got nothing”), but she also refuses to untie Bob’s apron after he cuts her from the ad. The North Remembers, Bob.</li>
<li>Bob’s utter lack of gay panic continues to be stealth-charming. When Louise makes fun of him for wanting to marry Sandy and becoming Bob Can Can, Bob’s only scoffing objection: “I wouldn’t take his name.”</li>
<li>No seriously, name one movie where puppets get water.</li>

The ideal for the show is a kind of sociological detachment from the proceedings—observing the characters like they’re in a natural history museum that keeps coming to life—while simultaneously shooting that detachment through with the empathy and mortification that comes from realizing that you <i>were</i>/<i>are</i> just like that. And of all episodes of <i>Girls</i>, perhaps none has ever struck me quite in that way quite as adroitly as “Deep Inside” did. Hannah’s inability to feel much over the death of her editor because she’s more worried about what might happen to her book is easy enough to judge. This is a time when she <i>should</i>, by all rights, at least be faking that she’s moderately upset about this. But she can’t. And, man, have I been there.</p>
<p>Honestly, it might not even be death that prompts this sort of reaction. I think in a lot of writers—maybe even most of them—there’s a kind of critical, observational detachment, a remove that separates head from heart, so that the contents of the latter can be spilled out on the page and organized by the former when it comes time to process these feelings. At this point, the people in my life are so used to me being much better at working through my emotions on the page than via any other form of communication that they just sort of roll with it, but there have been times when I’ve been in a really sad situation, when just about anybody else would be filled with despair or rage, and I’ve, instead, found some part of my brain whirring away about how this might make a wonderful piece when I just get the time to sit down and write it. Does this make me a monster? I hope not. But it made me much more sympathetic to Hannah in this episode than I suspect a lot of people are going to be.</p>
<p>The death of David Pressler-Goings is a solid idea to kick off this season, as it places Hannah in a place where she’s not sure how she should feel, while everybody else around her is saying, “You should probably be sad right now.” I liked John Cameron Mitchell in the part of David, but he was hardly essential to the show, and by taking him off the grid, the series can both force Hannah to realize just how callous she can be (at least a little bit) <i>and</i> give her slightly more to worry about in her professional life. David was that most vital thing to a young writer: someone who really believed Hannah had a voice worth cultivating. That’s not the sort of thing that can be found just anywhere, and without Hannah’s book already out there, she doesn’t have anything she can point to when trying to get other editors interested in her work. It might seem ghoulish for her to treat this death primarily as a chance to worry about her career, but it also makes complete sense.</p>
<p>I think the trick to the show’s balance this season is that the series is all too willing to point out Hannah’s flaws via the other characters, but then it keeps pointing and pointing and pointing, until you might say, “Well, sure, she’s fucked up, but aren’t we all?” That’s why I’m still not certain why the Caroline character is around. She feels almost like the show has loaded the deck <i>too much</i>, as if Lena Dunham and all involved in the series are trying to say, “Do you think Hannah’s crazy? Well, here’s someone who embodies all of the worst things people have said about Hannah on the Internet, and we’re going to take her to the ultimate degree.” The only stories Caroline tells us about who Adam was before Hannah are fairly obvious lies—stories concocted to try to get Hannah to break down in tears—and she’s so impetuous that she turns cartwheels in a cemetery without really giving it a second thought. The show has used characters who are basically plot devices before, but Caroline is the first one to feel like she’s meant to be a fairly major one. Not to mention that I think we’re supposed to find her somewhat insightful, at least in terms of her brother.</p>
<p>Maybe I’ll come around on Caroline, though, because I used to think the show largely wasted Jessa, and she’s become my favorite of the supporting female characters this season. Every week for Jessa is like a journey through people who have justifiable reasons to dislike her and have taken extreme measures to avoid having to see her again, and yet Jessa seems largely unbothered by this, as if she’s just used to the world rejecting her. In a way, it gives me more insight into her character than any possible reaction she could have. Is the idea of a friend staging a fake funeral so Jessa wouldn’t keep turning up and enabling her in her addictions a stretch? Sure. But the way that she simply accepts the idea that she never would have shown up at the funeral anyway and leaves the house is telling.</p>
<p>More and more, the show I’m reminded of as I watch this show is <i><a href="http://www.avclub.com/tv/the-sopranos/">The Sopranos</a>—</i>not necessarily because it’s so groundbreaking or anything like that, but because it’s asking you to understand the characters via the absence in their lives that’s present in other lives. When Jessa goes to Susan, she’s got a husband and baby. Susan has obviously pulled her life together from the point where Jessa last believed her to be alive. The foremost debate over <i>Girls</i> has always been whether Dunham is aware of her characters’ privilege—whether she’s dissecting how little that prepares them for the “real” world (whatever that is) and how much it insulates them from the way people without that privilege have to live. But like <i>The Sopranos</i>—which constantly held up off to the side the people whose lives were casually ruined by Tony, or showed people who <i>were</i> able to change their lives when Tony and the gang weren’t because of the corrupting influences of money and crime—<i>Girls</i> is placing people who’ve either lived without privilege or had that privilege punctured by something on the fringes this season, and it’s showing how much more able they are to build rewarding lives on their own terms than Hannah and company. (And, honestly, Hannah’s so much more stable this season, perhaps <i>because</i> she’s been living on her own terms for a year or so at this point.) It’s not always the most subtle technique—look! Susan has a baby! And a husband!—but when it works, like when it worked on <i>Sopranos</i>, it can be almost more insightful than directly telling us that these characters are sheltered and their own worst enemies.</p>
<p>Except maybe somebody needs to straight-up tell Marnie that, because she’s circling the drain and doesn’t seem to realize it yet. It’s been interesting to watch the show shift the things that Hannah used to say early in season one into the mouth of Marnie, who really seemed to have her life together at that point. (Or, at the very least, she had gainful employment and a seemingly devoted boyfriend.) One of the themes of <i>Girls</i> is wanting what someone else has, and Marnie followed that to a place that blew up her life. Blowing up your life can often be a good thing, because it allows you to build something else atop the rubble, but Marnie’s not yet realized that this might ultimately be some kind of turning point. So many times when we see Marnie this season, Allison Williams is wearing this tightly wound smile, and I’m waiting for it to shatter.</p>
<p>All of this lets us circle back around to Hannah, whose inability to know what to feel when it comes to this death marks her, once again, as the show’s emotional center. Season three increasingly seems to be shaping up as a season about how one is <i>supposed</i> to live—about finding the right partner and line of work and having all the right responses to all the right things. It’s impossible to say just how genuine Adam and Ray’s responses to the death of David are supposed to be. In both cases, they’re at least better at faking the accepted emotions than Hannah is, but they also have less on the line than she does. Without her book, Hannah is literally back at square one. There <i>is</i> some bit of compassion inside of her—we almost see it creep through when she talks about how much he meant to her before immediately launching into the story of Margaret at the end—but her own self interest is constantly getting in the way of that. Critics of the show often complain that they have trouble relating to Hannah, but in this moment, in this idea of how hard it can be to set aside the self and simply grieve in a moment like this, Dunham is reflecting one of those universal experiences we’d probably all rather not think about. Some deaths are easy to mourn, but some deaths you have to learn how to grieve.</p>
<p><b>Stray observations:</b></p>
<ul><li>When is HBO going to post the full video of Marnie Marie Michaels’ performance of “What I Am,” he said, not having checked YouTube to see if it was up there.</li>
<li>Hannah and Adam’s argument about whether Gawker is a necessary news outlet taking a critical look at the media world or just a bunch of snark merchants blathering away on the only platform that will have them was this week’s moment when the show seemed to be having a conversation with its harshest critics, made even more surreal by the whole thing with <i>Jezebel</i> trying to get the <a href="http://jezebel.com/were-offering-10-000-for-unretouched-images-of-lena-d-1502000514">unretouched photos</a> from Lena Dunham’s <i>Vogue</i> cover shoot these last few weeks. That said, Adam’s argument felt a little too much like something David Brooks might advance in one of his columns. Hannah would absolutely make people she considered to be dear friends in the comments section, though.</li>
<li>That said, “Goings, Goings, Gone” is pretty much the perfect <i>Gawker</i> headline.</li>
<li>I’m sure there will be the usual cries for more Shoshanna, but I think the show is using her in just the right amount in these episodes. Her scene with Jessa where they talked about losing friends was one of the episode’s funnier scenes precisely because of her presence.</li>
<li>Also: Ray is one of those who tells Hannah that she needs to be more compassionate in mourning David’s death, but when it comes to being compassionate toward Marnie in a time where she’s obviously flailing, he more or less fails. We all have our giant blind spots.</li>
<li>When Hannah starts telling Adam about Margaret, his body language seems to be like he’s going to call her on her bullshit because he’s heard this from his sister before, but it doesn’t happen. <i>CLIFFHANGER</i>?!?!?! (It’s not.)</li>
<li>I only now realized when checking the episodes list that episode six is written by Paul Simms of <i><a href="http://www.avclub.com/tv/newsradio/">NewsRadio</a></i> fame. I knew he would be joining the show this season, but I didn’t realize he would be getting a solo script. Hooray! (His work on the show reunites him with his old <i><a href="http://www.avclub.com/tv/the-larry-sanders-show/">Larry Sanders Show</a></i> colleague, Judd Apatow, who has <i>his</i> third script credit on the show tonight, shared with Dunham.) </li>

                <![CDATA[<img src=http://i.onionstatic.com/avclub/5013/65/16x9/565.jpg /><div><p class="p1">The most interesting plotline from tonight’s episode is never articulated: Edith has what rather looks like an abortion in London, quietly, without telling a soul. It appears that she wrote to Gregson about it, but he either never got it or hasn’t tried to respond. I guess after last week’s sexytimes, there were bound to be consequences—not because that’s realistic, but because that’s how <i>Downton Abbey</i> operates—like Chekov’s gun, except for sex. If there’s sex in the first act, there will be consequences in the second.</p>
<p class="p1">Which is more or less how Anna’s storyline has been handled, too, if you think about it. She’s not pregnant—thank <i>God</i>—and it’s hard to compare Edith’s romantic lovemaking to Anna’s brutal attack. But the way the repercussions are echoing through the storyline feel similar. Both characters handle their issues largely in silence: Anna doesn’t have the luxury of total silence, because she has to report to Mrs. Hughes and her nosy husband, but both Edith and Anna show remarkable steel handling their crises.</p>
<p class="p1">One of the best aspects of this show is how it subtly highlights just how differently men and women act, based on the rights and privileges they entertain. It’s striking here: Anna and Edith literally carry on their lives in silence. Meanwhile, Bates, Alfred, and even the Yorkshire farmer trying to settle a debt bring their concerns out in the open, front and center, where everyone can see it and respond to it. That, right there, is an example of privilege—an unspoken one, for sure, but the meaning is clear.</p>
<p class="p1">That being said, I am giving <i>Downton Abbey</i> a bit too much credit. Bates has been one of the show’s greatest flaws right since the beginning—a violent man we’re supposed to believe has a heart of gold, a man who has shown himself to be manipulative, controlling, and coercive. But the show doesn’t seem to notice his flaws—or, rather, it showcases them as strengths, instead. In this episode, I think we’re supposed to see Bates’ righteous indignation at being shut out from his wife as a kind of virtue; his bullying Mrs. Hughes as an expression of love. I call bullshit. I know Anna loves Bates, and to some degree, that makes it easier to overlook his flaws—but literally, his wife is terrified to tell him because she is afraid he will do something violent. Mrs. Hughes and Anna, on top of their <i>myriad other sufferings</i>, have to maintain a lie to keep Bates in line. And then to go on right away and confront Anna about it—forcibly, again!—and to somehow make it about <i>his</i> suffering! Jesus, Bates, <i>get a goddamn grip</i>.</p>
<p class="p1">Anyway, at least he knows now, and doubly, at least he convinced her that she’s not “spoiled” because she was brutally raped. (Although: “I have never loved you more nor been prouder of you than in this moment”? I don’t know about that. Being raped doesn’t make you more noble.) And Bates aside, I stand my ground that Joanne Frogatt’s Anna has brought this dicey plotline from what could have been tawdry, offensive melodrama to a moving character performance on moving past victimization. By the end of the episode, Anna’s moved back to the cottage, and is crying a lot less—so if she’s doing better, I’m more willing to buy the plotline in its entirety.</p>
<p class="p2">Otherwise, this is a rather dull episode, to be quite honest. The only other thing of note is that Evelyn Napier returns, which is a delicate, lovely nod back to season one. I thought Evelyn had gotten married to someone else, but maybe he didn’t—certainly, he doesn’t <i>act</i> married, when he checks out Mary in her pretty magenta blouse. There wasn’t enough of him. Hopefully we’ll see more. He, Lord Grantham, Branson, and Mary engage in some estate-related business with a farm that has gone into debt; Violet and Isobel spar over a gardener; Alfred goes to London for the cooking test, but fails; Molesley is still getting screwed in every which direction. The storylines interweave really well—most of the events in this episode take place because a tenant dies of old age—but none of them are all that engaging. Not enough pretty dresses, <i>Downton Abbey</i>.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Stray observations:</b></p>
<ul><li>Everything Edith was wearing in this episode—<i>fabulous</i>. That blue tunic-coat thing, with the matching hat, should be illegal. Also, worth noticing that Isobel and Mary are still wearing partial mourning—purples, greys, and blacks. Everyone else has moved on, I think.</li>
<li>Can we please settle, once and for all, how old Daisy is? Her schoolgirl crush on Alfred is adorable, but isn’t she something like 25? (And a <i>widow</i>?)</li>
<li>Lord Gillingham is getting married, of course. Even odds he never makes it to the wedding. </li>

Handled honestly and without condescension to the audience, something like the end of Rust and Marty’s working relationship can draw a viewer deeper into the show’s world, making them more perceptive of the breadcrumbs being dropped along the way. But those breadcrumbs could also end up as a distraction—or more disheartening, a narrative crutch. Some mysteries insist on keeping their secrets, because there’d be no story without them.</p><p><i>True Detective</i> has so far avoided this pitfall, granting character and story prominence over the season-long whodunit. There are times where the show teases viewers with the details of its unknowns—like why the team of Hart and Cohle went kaput—but the tease is never the point. When “The Locked Room” drops a clue, it’s in service of the things that make for compelling television. Marty doesn’t sarcastically refer to Rust as “Mr. Charisma” to make us wonder “What ended this partnership?” That little sobriquet is a step down the path to that split, a feint toward the tension that has to snap eventually.</p><p>“The Locked Room” thrives on the growing resentment between its two protagonists—but it’s a resentment that only travels in one direction. Woody Harrelson’s character fancies himself a shining example of old-school masculinity, the American ideal of husband and father, protector and provider. He’s never going to meet Rust halfway on anything because Rust, in his monk-like solitude and tangle of personal philosophies, doesn’t represent a “proper” man in Marty’s eyes. The partners complement each other on the job, but outside of the squad car they don’t mesh—and the strain is beginning to show.</p><p>Rust really steps in it this week when he offers some handyman services around the Hart house. It’s all in Harrelson’s voice as Marty takes his partner to task: “You mow my lawn?” It’s classic “a man’s home is his castle” bullshit, and it’s about much more than the garbage bin full of grass clippings. It’s about the people who live in the house at the edge of that lawn, one woman and two girls who Marty regards as little more than symbols of his manhood. He preaches the gospel of family and responsibility, but Maggie and the girls may as well be plaster ornaments, each holding a sign that reads “Martin Hart is a big ol’ slice of virile man.” In an episode where one potential suspect in the Lange case was castrated in prison, Marty’s actions radiate with insecurity.</p><p>Once more, I don’t think any of this works without Rust being there to serve as a funhouse mirror distorting and rebutting all that Marty holds near and dear. Marty acts out of a discomfort with the “perfect” life he’s made for himself, whereas Rust acts assured in an existence that’s in shambles from his partner’s POV. Both are men who’ve been broken by certainty: Marty hits self-destruct on a life he tells himself and others is the only proper way to live; Rust withdraws and withers because he’s convinced that life isn’t worth it. Matthew McConaughey ponderously babbles his way through “The Locked Room,” but Rust is getting easier to comprehend as his dialogue grows ever more incomprehensible. (It probably isn’t helping that the number of empty beer cans on the table is increasing.) </p><p>Marty is the less compelling of the season’s two leads, but he owns the best <i>True Detective</i> to date. That stems from factors within and without the content of “The Locked Room”: Harrelson turns in a towering performance this week, but Marty is also the dominant narrator of this chapter. Officer Hart’s no more reliable than his shell-shocked former partner, but “The Locked Room” occupies itself with putting the lie to his many contradictions. All this talk about the importance of family, and he’s doing nothing but destroying his own. He doesn’t take Audrey’s school problems seriously, he’s distracted by Lisa during the double date, and then he stays out all night on a liquor-and-jealousy bender. There’s a bit of obvious symbolism in his car crushing a pink bike (not to mention a parallel to Rust’s own sad situation), but the force of that incident is crucial to illustrating the wrecking ball effect Marty is having on his own home life.</p><p>Rust would have the better explanation of why family is so fluid in the world of <i>True Detective</i>; it’d probably sound a lot like what Grandpa Crabber (when you don’t name your characters, your characters get named for you, show) offers up during his meeting with Hart and Cohle at the docks. But in line with their conflicting philosophies involving the abstract and the concrete, it’s fitting that Marty should be the one to provide the evidence of how a family falls apart. In the hard-boiled milieu of this story, life is cheap and human connections cheaper: Family members take flight for selfish reasons, leaving the selfless behind to clean up their messes. Marty’s especially touchy this week because he can sense his co-worker being slotted into the husband and father positions he should be occupying himself. (This isn’t to say that Rust himself is selfless, per se, because his MO is faux-noble selfishness.)</p><p>Its preference for Marty’s side of the story aside, “The Locked Room” offers some succinct summaries of Rust’s outlook on life: the analogy of the title, the “there’s a monster at the end” soliloquy, his notion about bad men keeping other bad men from the door. That last one’s a basic distinction between his philosophy and Marty’s, though both inform the “certainties” that drive them to behave as they do. Rust accepts that he’s not the dictionary definition of a good person; Marty’s internal tensions are driven by someone else’s sense of right and wrong. The most insurmountable hurdle between the men is religion, and religion is all up in “The Locked Room,” from the opening scenes at the tent revival to that radio dial full of nothing but Christian broadcasts. There’s no greater illustration of Marty’s faith in order and structure—or Rust’s impression that the only true order is chaos. As police officers, they’re sworn to uphold that order that only one of them believes in. </p><p>Tonight’s episode gets a lot of mileage out of those colliding viewpoints, but that final freeze frame calls the cops’ bluffs. (Makes sense: Rust tells Gilbough and Papania he isn’t any good at card games.) There <i>is</i> a man out there who’s living without rules, structure, or discipline—it’s the guy stomping around his property in tighty whities and a gas mask. Rust has come across a lot of lowlifes, and he can read a person within 10 minutes of meeting them, but he isn’t as consumed by the darkness as the specter that stalks through the final seconds of “The Locked Room.” Or maybe he is, and <i>True Detective</i> is holding back the truth of the matter for the time being. Secret or no secret, that’s a hell of a way to pull the viewer into the next episode.</p><p><b>Stray observations:</b></p><ul><li>Speaking of the next episode: While HBO opted to juke the Super Bowl by airing <i>Girls</i> and <i>Looking </i>on February 1, <i>True Detective</i> is taking next week off. We’re back on February 9 with “Who Goes There.”</li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">“The Locked Room” features some of the finest photography of the show so far. Its use of color plays to the strengths of setting a noir in this time period: The pop of light from the photocopier, the reds of Lisa’s apartment, the yellow stage lights at the dancehall, the pink bike.

For the first 10 episodes of this 25th season, I’d like to think I’ve succeeded in doing that—lauding the good (a <a href="http://www.avclub.com/review/yellow-subterfuge-106313" target="_blank">solid Principal Skinner performance</a> here, a delightful drop-in from a <a href="http://www.avclub.com/review/the-simpsons-treehouse-of-horror-xxiv-103758" target="_blank">guest director</a> there), calling out the really, really bad (desecrating one of the most beautiful classic episodes for a <a href="http://www.avclub.com/review/the-kid-is-all-right-105377" target="_blank">callous throwaway gag</a>), and generally avoiding the trope of “it ain’t as good as it used to be” (because there’s nothing duller in the world than that exact sentence). It’s been, if nothing else, a writing challenge against the ever-lurking specter of TV critic hackery.</p>
<p>But this one might have beaten me.</p>
<p>It’s not that “Specs And The City” (wherein Mr. Burns’s gift of Google Glass-style eyewear to his employees leads Homer to a surprising revelation about Marge), is a bad episode of <i>The Simpsons</i>, or even a bad episode of television. It’s that it’s so nondescript that it seems constructed according to the guidelines of a sample spec script template—it hits all the recognizable beats of a <i>Simpsons</i> episode without imbuing any of them with originality, personality, or, you know, laughs. There was one thing that annoyed me, a handful of moderately amusing lines, and then it was over. I keep having to go back to my notes to remember story details watched twice only minutes ago. Not a good sign.</p>
<p>Apparently, there are a great number of you out there who maintain that the “Mapple” episode of a few years ago was one of the worst <i>Simpsons</i> episodes ever. (I’ll concede that the “Mapple/Steve Mobbs” references were not the height of parodic imagination.) So the introduction of another easily identifiable, indifferently renamed high tech gadget (“Oogle Goggles”) may be cause for alarm, I suppose. The real trouble with this element, though, is that there’s so little done with it. Apart from setting the main plot in motion—in which Marge appropriates Homer’s pair and he then discovers she’s seeing a therapist to complain about him—the goggles are largely wasted as a source of comedy, insight, or satire. Sure, I suppose the fact that Mr. Burns is able to use them to spy on his employees is a reference to the multitude of security and privacy concerns people are expressing about the goggles’ real-world inspiration, but this episode (credited to Brian Kelley) takes only the feeblest swipes at how the ubiquity of such technology affects people’s lives. Also, whenever the show incorporates such a specific topical gimmick in an episode, you can practically feel its entertainment shelf-life counting down.</p>
<p>The <i>Terminator</i>-style pop-up facts they impart about everything Homer looks at are an old gag (Abed on <a href="http://www.avclub.com/review/community-aerodynamics-of-gender-47075" target="_blank"><i>Community</i></a>, Homer himself—sans goggles—way back in season two), which wouldn’t be a problem if the references were funny. Instead, we learn that: Lenny has a lot of DUIs, Carl’s a genius, and Krustyburgers are mostly shredded newspapers and hamster bedding. Oh, and Mr. Burns has been dead since 1998. Not terrible jokes, but then again, hardly jokes—like much of this episode, they just sit there. In a mediocre latter-day Simpsons episode, I find myself registering jokes as such and then forgetting them immediately. (At times like these, I really understand the dispirited game of tag from “Team Homer”: “You’re it.” “Now you are the one who is it.” “Understood.”)</p>
<p>There’s a B-story as well, with Bart rebelling against having to give Nelson a valentine, which—let me consult my notes—he does, but only after composing a card that tells Nelson that he’s a bully and everyone’s afraid of him and he should be nicer. It’s as pedestrian as these things get, which only underscores the seeming laziness of the episode’s execution, again. In a great episode, the A- and B-stories either compliment each other thematically or are both just plain funny in isolation. This one practically had “insert B-story here” time-stamped on it. (The one good exchange: Nelson, sniffing the valentine: “This smells like fear.” Bart: “I rubbed it on Milhouse.”)</p>
<p>As to the main plot: It’s not important whether Homer (or Marge, Lisa, Bart, Barney, Moe, or anyone else in Springfield) has learned a<i> </i>particular episode’s lesson before in the past 25 years. The beauty of <i>The Simpsons</i> is that it allows its titular family to, individually or collectively, represent the archetypical foibles and dilemmas of the American family for an episode wherein a theme can be comically examined­–only for things to snap back into something like their original shape, so the show can do it again the next week. Sure, there’s some carryover in character development, but that’s mostly in superficial plot elements (Lisa’s vegetarianism, for example), allowing the writers and performers the opportunity to attack the problem of, for this episode, Homer being a lazy, insensitive, selfish husband and father from a theoretically inexhaustible variety of angles. Those who gripe that “Homer already leaned not to be that way in episodes X,Y, &amp; Z” are missing the point. Even in “the good years,” there was constant repetition of Homer realizing that he should be a better husband and father—the fact that he needs to relearn those lessons again and again is inherently Homer. That’s what <em>makes</em> him Homer—and <i>that</i>, I contend, is why he’s such an enduringly interesting and even touching character.</p>
<p>That all being said, this strength of Homer as character only applies if his individual story is told with insight, imagination, and on-target satire. Or, you know, if it’s just really funny. In tonight’s episode, Homer’s realization that Marge’s Wednesday good moods are the result of her weekly therapy appointments, resulting in happy-face cakes and plenty of snuggling, is fine for what it reveals about the Simpsons’ marriage—Marge needs a weekly relief valve to complain in order to remember why she’s in the marriage in the first place—but in execution, like the rest of the episode, it remains dramatically and comedically inert.</p>
<p><b>Stray observations</b>:</p>
<ul><li>Whether it was a network promo or an overly long lead-in to the episode proper, the Fox NFL Sunday Super Bowl shilling at the beginning added nothing to the show’s viewing experience, unless an animated Terry Bradshaw calling Homer “baldy” is your thing.</li>
<li>Oh, and then the couch gag shilled for the Super Bowl even harder. Wait, what channel is the game on again?</li>
<li>To brush up on Google Glass, I looked it up... on Bing! Unlike Fox, Dennis don’t play corporate synergy.</li>
<li>Lisa’s on the sideline this episode, but it’s her questioning of the whole “everyone gets a valentine” tradition that spurred the one line that almost made me laugh, Marge’s “Lisa, what did I say about pointing out the meaninglessness of things?”</li>
<li>Marge’s reference to the goggles as “bleep-bloop glasses” sounds like a Conan O’Brien line. Which is a compliment, of course.</li>
<li>Homer pointing up to show Lenny the proper spelling of “Simpson” in the credits constantly rolling in the sky is the sort of reality-puncturing, self-referential gag that I hate most. It’s a reference for its own sake, takes us out of the story, and speaks to a lack of commitment to the show’s integrity.</li>
<li>Homer, rating internet videos on a certain site: “Funny, funny, funny, die, funny but the guy died.”</li>
<li>From the positioning, it appears that Homer is watching an instructional video on his Oogle Goggles about how to orally pleasure Marge while, as Marge puts it, “snuggling.” Look, I don’t want to think about these things any more than you people do...</li>
