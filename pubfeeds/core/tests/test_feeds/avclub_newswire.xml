                <div><p>Timber Timbre’s sexy new album, <i><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjmQPv6-dDw">Hot Dreams</a></i>, is due out April 1, and in (reference totally intended) anticipation, <i>The A.V. Club </i>is streaming the video for the album’s first single and title track. The track features ancillary Bon Iver and Arcade Fire bro Colin Stetson on sax, and the video finds the track set to a whole bunch of bumping, grinding, and red light specials. It’s an erotic video eruption, but not one that’s so racy you have to watch it in some sort of sticky booth.</p>
<p>Timber Timbre has a couple of North American dates coming up in advance of the record. Interested parties can check those out <a href="http://www.timbertimbre.com/tour.php">here</a>.</p>

<p>The cage has obviously seen better days since it hosted that blood-and-safari-clothes-bath, and the seller notes that the inevitable wear and tear is visible on both crate and raptor. Indeed, the latter is more “clever woman” than “clever girl” now. But for those looking for a “restoration project”—or who don’t mind paying upwards of $99,900 (at last bid), plus transportation costs out of L.A., for a less than pristine velociraptor cage—you still have eight days left to bid. Or <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/331115447671" target="_blank">you could buy the mobile RV lab from <i>The Lost World</i> for much, much less</a>. Or you could probably pay Wayne Knight to just hang with you for a day or two.  </p>

There shouldn’t need to be an award!” She went on to cite a lack of access as the root cause for the whitewashing of television, saying, “If it’s been a white boys club for 70 years, that’s a lot of white boys hiring one another. And I don’t believe that that happens out of any specific racism or sexism or prejudice. People hire their friends. They hire who they know.”</p>
<p>Rhimes highlighted her commitment to creating fictional worlds that are as diverse as the one she lives in, saying she believes the myriad of voices she presents onscreen has helped her work captivate the public. And given that <i>Grey’s Anatomy </i>is set to enter its 11th seasonm and <i>Scandal </i>is currently one of the most talked-about shows on TV, she has the success to back up that claim.</p>
<p>At the end of her speech, Rhimes acknowledged the complexity of trying to fix television's lack of diversity: “We’re also proud that the DGA recognizes a problem and are trying to fix it," she said. "The DGA, by the way, is the only Guild giving out this type of award in an attempt to draw attention to the problem, which I think is kind of badass.” It must be said that Rhimes, the sole prominent black female showrunner in television, is also something of a badass. She and Beers left the stage to a standing ovation.</p></div>]]>

<p>Harold’s version would replace the King Arthur concept Ritchie was reportedly working on with<em> Trainspotting</em>’s John Hodge <a href="http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/blogs/popcornbiz/Guy-Ritchies-Next-Movie-Crusade-King-Arthurs-Round-Table-87251992.html" target="_blank">in 2012</a>—though there’s no indication yet of how his take differs. (Fewer mead overdoses?) Still, Guy Ritchie is apparently very anxious to apply his stylized slow-motion and spinning camera angles to knights swinging swords, and this dovetails nicely with Warner Bros.’ desire to keep theaters tied up with fantasy franchises for decades at a time.  </p></div>]]>

First comes the announcement of the actor (this time with <a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/peter-capaldi-named-12th-doctor,101165/" target="_blank">more fanfare than the Royal Wedding</a>). Then there's his first onscreen appearance (which kind of already <a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-day-of-the-doctor,105925/" target="_blank">happened</a> <a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-time-of-the-doctor,106556/" target="_blank">twice</a>). And finally there's the reveal of his new costume, a box that Whovians can check off now that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/doctorwho/articles/Peter-Capaldi-Doctor-Who-Costume-Revealed-" target="_blank">the BBC has released</a> the below first image of Peter Capaldi in the 12th Doctor's costume, confirming he’s wearing, well, clothes.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Scottish actor is wearing a navy Crombie coat, a cardigan, and some ill-fitting pants, which—coupled with a rather dramatic hand gesture—make him look like the sternest magician in the world. Speaking of the 12th Doctor’s look, Capaldi said, “He’s woven the future from the cloth of the past. Simple, stark, and back to basics. No frills, no scarf, no messing, just 100 percent Rebel Time Lord.” The term “Rebel Time Lord” is sure to cause a flurry of activity on Tumblr as fans speculate about the 12th Doctor's personality, as will the fact that this ensemble is fairly similar<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8aZsF0UGxbs/UV22fYi9XMI/AAAAAAAAO4Q/LvC_wraalss/s1600/bells%2Bof%2Bst%2Bjohn%2Bportrait-1.jpg" target="_blank"> to the 11th Doctor</a>’s later costume. Still, the red lining of the coat and the Doc Martens add a certain edgy flair, which seems fitting for an actor who once fronted a punk rock band and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5zhExXiL8A" target="_blank">dropped acid with Craig Ferguson</a>.</p>
<p>The show’s eighth season—the first for Capaldi—is filming now in Cardiff. There’s no official premiere date yet, but the show is expected to return in fall 2014. According to showrunner Steven Moffat, “Capaldi is suited and booted and coming to get you!” Basically, run.</p>

McLaren’s version was later sampled in Neneh Cherry’s 1988 hit “Buffalo Stance.” The hat originally appeared in Westwood’s ‘82/’83 collection, and has several names, including the “Buffalo Hat,” the “Mountain Hat,” and “the Jelly Mould Hat.”</p>

<p>While Williams’ hat isn’t vintage—he bought a new copy at Westwood’s World’s End store a couple of years ago for £95—he acknowledges it would have been “really stylin’,” if he’d been sporting “one from the ‘80s.” Knowing the nature of celebrity gifting these days, it’s fair to imagine that the process of getting him an actual vintage model is at least in the works by now, if not already a fait accompli.</p>

                <div><p>Last summer, the National Association of Theater Owners <a href="http://www.avclub.com/article/now-even-movie-theater-owners-think-the-trailers-a-98392" target="_blank">responded</a> to the <a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/your-cranky-uncle-mayor-michael-bloomberg-has-had,93498/" target="_blank">increasingly</a> <a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/new-study-confirms-people-think-movie-trailers-giv,97308/" target="_blank">loud</a> protest over the lengths of movie trailers, vowing to do something about the one grievance it might possibly be able to redress.

(Especially as it remains powerless against runner-up grievances, like “That movie was boring” and “Someone shot me.”) Now it’s taken the first, gentle step in that direction by releasing voluntary guidelines asking that studios <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/theater-owners-enact-new-guidelines-674417" target="_blank">limit their trailers’ lengths to no more than two minutes</a>—30 seconds shorter than the current norm.</p>
<p>This would then ostensibly limit the amount of time theater managers have to spend enduring “the brunt of complaints from the public” about it, freeing them to instead turn their attention to, say, Kevin’s constantly untucked shirt. (<i>Do you own an iron, Kevin? And do you know how to use it?</i>) Of course, it would also limit trailers’ ability to give away their movies’ plot, leaving audiences uncertain whether the main character might end up being lucky in love, despite all comical appearances to the contrary—because they just couldn’t stand it if they weren’t.</p>
<p>Instead, they'll get a mere two minutes to get to know the main characters, the primary antagonist, the supporting characters, the tertiary characters, the one person who maybe isn't technically a "character" but provides a standout moment of comic relief, the basic conflict that drives the film, the plot twist that complicates that conflict, the beginning of the resolution to that conflict, the hint of that conflict's denouement, the three or four biggest action scenes or set pieces, and all of the most quotable lines of dialogue.</p>
<p>Still, <i>this</i> NATO, for one, is willing to take the risk of upsetting some people. It’s also asked that studios limit trailers and in-theater marketing displays to no more than five months before a movie’s release, suggesting we may now only see ads for movies that are more or less “finished.” However, NATO is also willing to grant studios two exceptions per year on both trailer length and marketing lead time, to be reserved only for their most special blockbusters that they weren’t already going to ignore these guidelines on anyway. Because, again—despite some studios’ fears that exhibitors may use these suggested rules to refuse to play longer trailers, or use the time limits to cram in more trailers they then get paid for—adopting them remains totally voluntary.</p>
<p>This meek, polite cough in the direction of the cigar-smoking, brazenly texting, openly masturbating movie studios in their theaters further includes a request that trailers not feature any third-party brands—instantly disqualifying all of Adam Sandler’s films—or any Internet URLs that might “encourage mobile phone use during the show,” presumably besides what’s already occurring. And, perhaps well aware that these guidelines aren’t likely to accomplish much, they enact perhaps their harshest restrictions (as <i><a href="http://www.deadline.com/2014/01/theater-owners-want-movie-trailers-limited-to-2-minutes/" target="_blank">Deadline</a> </i>points out), on distributor-hired auditors, demanding that they “be professional in dress and demeanor,” not “take up a seat” or “interact with guests,” and generally be beholden to the one area in which theater managers actually exert some semblance of control. Still, for audiences tired of being distracted from their 30 minutes of trailers by some chatty, sloppily dressed auditor, real change is coming.  </p></div>]]>

Club </i>readers can get a sneak peak at its first single right now. “Mars” is streaming below, and aptly demonstrates Langford’s gradual and logical shift from young punk to country punk. Fans of the track and of the man can pre-order <i>Here Be Monsters </i>as a <a href="http://amzn.to/KQmqQl" target="_blank">CD</a> or <a href="http://amzn.to/19SdA0x" target="_blank">LP</a><i> </i>now via Amazon. Each song comes paired with a piece of specific, Langford-designed artwork, prints of which will be included as inserts with the album.</p>

But whatever, right?</p>

Of course, Grammy producers didn’t actually <em>tell</em> the band this, leading to an irate post-show tweet from Reznor, who <a href="https://twitter.com/trent_reznor/status/427674918138826752" target="_blank">wrote</a> that the ceremony was “Music’s biggest night… to be disrespected,” and offered, “a heartfelt FUCK YOU” to the organizers.</p>
