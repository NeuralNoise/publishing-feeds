<p>The cage has obviously seen better days since it hosted that blood-and-safari-clothes-bath, and the seller notes that the inevitable wear and tear is visible on both crate and raptor. Indeed, the latter is more “clever woman” than “clever girl” now. But for those looking for a “restoration project”—or who don’t mind paying upwards of $99,900 (at last bid), plus transportation costs out of L.A., for a less than pristine velociraptor cage—you still have eight days left to bid.

<p>Harold’s version would replace the King Arthur concept Ritchie was reportedly working on with<em> Trainspotting</em>’s John Hodge <a href="http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/blogs/popcornbiz/Guy-Ritchies-Next-Movie-Crusade-King-Arthurs-Round-Table-87251992.html" target="_blank">in 2012</a>—though there’s no indication yet of how his take differs. (Fewer mead overdoses?) Still, Guy Ritchie is apparently very anxious to apply his stylized slow-motion and spinning camera angles to knights swinging swords, and this dovetails nicely with Warner Bros.’ desire to keep theaters tied up with fantasy franchises for decades at a time.  </p></div>]]>

(Especially as it remains powerless against runner-up grievances, like “That movie was boring” and “Someone shot me.”) Now it’s taken the first, gentle step in that direction by releasing voluntary guidelines asking that studios <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/theater-owners-enact-new-guidelines-674417" target="_blank">limit their trailers’ lengths to no more than two minutes</a>—30 seconds shorter than the current norm.</p>

<p>This would then ostensibly limit the amount of time theater managers have to spend enduring “the brunt of complaints from the public” about it, freeing them to instead turn their attention to, say, Kevin’s constantly untucked shirt. (<i>Do you own an iron, Kevin? And do you know how to use it?</i>) Of course, it would also limit trailers’ ability to give away their movies’ plot, leaving audiences uncertain whether the main character might end up being lucky in love, despite all comical appearances to the contrary—because they just couldn’t stand it if they weren’t.</p>
<p>Instead, they'll get a mere two minutes to get to know the main characters, the primary antagonist, the supporting characters, the tertiary characters, the one person who maybe isn't technically a "character" but provides a standout moment of comic relief, the basic conflict that drives the film, the plot twist that complicates that conflict, the beginning of the resolution to that conflict, the hint of that conflict's denouement, the three or four biggest action scenes or set pieces, and all of the most quotable lines of dialogue.</p>
<p>Still, <i>this</i> NATO, for one, is willing to take the risk of upsetting some people. It’s also asked that studios limit trailers and in-theater marketing displays to no more than five months before a movie’s release, suggesting we may now only see ads for movies that are more or less “finished.” However, NATO is also willing to grant studios two exceptions per year on both trailer length and marketing lead time, to be reserved only for their most special blockbusters that they weren’t already going to ignore these guidelines on anyway. Because, again—despite some studios’ fears that exhibitors may use these suggested rules to refuse to play longer trailers, or use the time limits to cram in more trailers they then get paid for—adopting them remains totally voluntary.</p>
<p>This meek, polite cough in the direction of the cigar-smoking, brazenly texting, openly masturbating movie studios in their theaters further includes a request that trailers not feature any third-party brands—instantly disqualifying all of Adam Sandler’s films—or any Internet URLs that might “encourage mobile phone use during the show,” presumably besides what’s already occurring. And, perhaps well aware that these guidelines aren’t likely to accomplish much, they enact perhaps their harshest restrictions (as <i><a href="http://www.deadline.com/2014/01/theater-owners-want-movie-trailers-limited-to-2-minutes/" target="_blank">Deadline</a> </i>points out), on distributor-hired auditors, demanding that they “be professional in dress and demeanor,” not “take up a seat” or “interact with guests,” and generally be beholden to the one area in which theater managers actually exert some semblance of control. Still, for audiences tired of being distracted from their 30 minutes of trailers by some chatty, sloppily dressed auditor, real change is coming.  </p></div>]]>

This week:</i> <i>With the Super Bowl happening on Sunday, we’ve lined up a week of movies about football and its fans.</i></p><p><b><i>The Longest Yard</i> (1974)</b></p><p>Legendary tough-guy director Robert Aldrich delivers a pigskin treatise on what it means to be a man with <i>The Longest Yard</i>, in which incomparable ’70s stud Burt Reynolds discovers that if you act dishonorably by caring only about yourself, you get what you deserve. Reynolds plays former star NFL quarterback Paul Crewe, who opens the film beating up his sugar-mama girlfriend, stealing her Maserati, leading the police on a high-speed car chase, and then punching out a cop. Having lost his career to a point-shaving scandal—and thus been decried as a whore for selling himself to the highest bidder—Crewe winds up in the big house. A sadistic warden (Eddie Albert) and his right-hand enforcer (Ed Lauter) first work hard to break him, and when those plans fail, they force him to organize an inmate football squad (dubbed “The Mean Machine”) that’ll play a game against the prison guards’ excellent “semi-pro” team.</p><p>Aldrich and screenwriter Tracy Keenan Wynn push Crewe through several tests of virtue, devising situations that force him to bridge racial divides for the sake of the team or reevaluate the life he’s lived as a stooge. That last trial comes in the climactic game: Crewe is again given the choice between looking out for his own hide by making a deal with the devil, or sacrificing his own interests in favor of honorably siding with his comrades. Aldrich stages the final game with impressive brutality and realism, but <i>The Longest Yard</i> is Reynolds’ show. It provides a near-flawless vehicle for the actor’s don’t-tread-on-me manliness and—whether he’s joking with the boys or casually wooing Bernadette Peters’ beehived secretary with an offhand, “Did you ever do it standing up?”—his devil-may-care macho charm.</p><p><b>Availability:</b> <i>The Longest Yard</i> is available on DVD, and is streaming on Netflix.</p>

<p>The suit continues, “This time, they went too far. Rather than merely publishing a news story reporting that Plaintiff’s screenplay may have been circulating in Hollywood without his permission, Gawker Media crossed the journalistic line by promoting itself to the public as the first source to read the entire Screenplay illegally.” (And with that, every other site that <a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/read-some-plot-details-from-quentin-tarantinos-scr,107253/" target="_blank">merely published a news story summarizing some of its broader details</a> breathed a cautious sigh of relief.)</p>
<p>While Tarantino said around the time of the initial leak that “<a href="http://www.deadline.com/2014/01/quentin-tarantino-hateful-eight-leak-novel/" target="_blank">I do like the fact that everyone eventually posts [the script], gets it and reviews it on the net</a>,” in this case he feels “there was nothing newsworthy or journalistic about Gawker Media facilitating and encouraging the public’s violation of Plaintiff’s copyright in the screenplay.” And while <em>Defamer</em> itself didn’t actually host the screenplay, the suit blasts the site for the way it “brazenly encourages” its readers to “enjoy” it through a “conveniently anonymous URL.” Since that post, <em>Defamer </em>has reportedly ignored “repeat demands” to remove the links. Regrettably, should this case go to court, Tarantino won’t get an awkward reunion with <a href="http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2013/12/8537855/three-leave-gawker" target="_blank">recently departed <em>Defamer </em>editor Beejoli Shah</a>, who got the job after going viral with <a href="http://defamer.gawker.com/i-got-my-toes-sucked-by-tarantino-and-all-i-got-was-thi-1165348563" target="_blank">her story about Tarantino sucking her toes.</a> That would have made for a really good episode of <em>Law &amp; Order</em>.</p><p><b>UPDATE: </b><a href="http://www.avclub.com"><i href="http://gawker.com/quentin-tarantino-sues-gawker-over-link-to-script-he-wa-1510095159?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+gawker%2Ffull+%28Gawker%29">Gawker</i> has finally responded</a>, presenting a bullet-pointed list of rejoinders. As one might expect, chief among its arguments is that the site didn’t actually leak the script or even host the leak—merely that it provided a link to a site that did. It also counters that, because Tarantino “deliberately turned the leak into a story” himself, while also seemingly saying he likes the inevitable Internet discussion of his leaked scripts, writing about the leak was simply part of the site “making people aware of news and information about which they are curious.” </p><p>Furthermore, the actual charge is “contributory copyright infringement,” a hazy legal area that’s typically involved lawsuits against file-sharing services or Google for linking to  other, more explicitly infringing sites, and which could make prosecuting <i>Gawker</i> difficult.  In short, <i>Gawker</i>’s John Cook concludes, “We’ll be fighting this one.”  Seeing as it’s a war of words, we imagine Tarantino will too.</p></div>]]>

<p>Another film about music, <i>Alive Inside: A Story Of Music &amp; Memory</i>, took home the Audience Award for U.S. Documentary, while jurors opted instead for <i>Rich Hill</i>, about kids growing up in a one-horse Missouri town. Meanwhile, the Nick Cave documentary <i>20,000 Days On Earth</i> took home two prizes for editing and directing of a World Cinema Documentary, while the comedy<i> Dear White People</i> was handed a special jury award for Breakthrough New Talent. Some of the festival’s most talked-about titles, including Zach Braff’s sophomore feature <i><a href="http://www.avclub.com/article/sundance-2014-day-three-zach-braff-still-feels-stu-200883">Wish I Was Here</a></i> and Richard Linklater’s ambitious <i><a href="http://www.avclub.com/article/sundance-2014-day-four-boyhood-is-a-one-of-a-kind--200896">Boyhood</a></i>, screened out of competition and were thus ineligible for awards.

In other words, by this point you should just forget about trying to predict what will happen at the Academy Awards, and make all of your Oscar pool selections based on who would win in a fistfight.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Jehane Noujaim continued to build Netflix’s rep with a Documentary win for <i>The Square</i>. On the TV side, Vince Gilligan collected his first—and now last—award for directing <i>Breaking Bad</i>, Beth McCarthy-Miller similarly picked up one final award for <i>30 Rock</i>, and Steven Soderbergh continued to make all who passed on distributing <i>Behind The Candelabra</i> look like fools by adding yet another trophy to its haul. And after seven nominations for directing <i>Saturday Night Live</i> episodes dating back to 2006, Don Roy King finally won one for an episode starring Justin Timberlake. None of these people are technically up for the Oscars either, though really, you might do just as well betting on them.  </p></div>]]>

<p>Raise your hand if you love your cable company. Now raise your hand if you didn’t raise your hand just now. There we go. As I write this column, analysts are justifiably wringing their hands about the recent court decision that effectively ended net neutrality, but the more fundamental problem with cable—and with the delivery of high-speed Internet in particular—is that most of us have no alternative to whatever massive conglomerate is dicking us around. If your area is served by, say, Time Warner Cable, your only options are TWC or TCBY; either you accept their terms or you head for the nearby yogurt place and hope to hell they offer free Wi-Fi. Consequently, the handful of cable giants can do pretty much whatever they like, without being overly concerned about customer satisfaction. So universal is the grumbling that <a href="http://www.avclub.com/tv/south-park/"><i>South Park</i></a> recently devoted <a href="http://www.avclub.com/review/south-park-informative-murder-porn-103580">the bulk of an episode</a> to cable employees rubbing their own nipples, while sarcastically mocking filed complaints about their service.</p>
<p>But this problem is hardly new. In 1967, a filmmaker named Theodore J. Flicker devised a satire of spy movies called <i>The President’s Analyst,</i> starring James Coburn in the title role. Initially, the film is exactly what it sounds like: a comedy about the difficulties involved in plumbing the psyche of the world’s most powerful man. (Decades later, the same idea would be applied to mobsters in <a href="http://www.avclub.com/tv/the-sopranos/"><i>The Sopranos</i></a> and <a href="http://www.avclub.com/review/analyze-this-18658"><i>Analyze This</i></a><i>.</i>) As it progresses, however, <i>The President’s Analyst</i> turns increasingly bizarre, with Coburn’s hero, Dr. Sidney Schaefer, being repeatedly pursued, kidnapped, and otherwise manhandled by a series of nefarious organizations ranging from the CIA (here called the CEA, for Central Enquiries Agency) to Canadian Secret Service agents posing as a British rock band. Only at the very end of the movie do we learn who’s been pulling the strings all along, and it’s not a naturally suspected entity.</p>

</div>
<p>At the time that <i>The President’s Analyst</i> was made, there really was a single, monolithic phone company: AT&amp;T, which ran the entire country’s telephone business under the umbrella known as the Bell System. It would be another 17 years before the Justice Department succeeded in breaking up this monopoly, opening the door for all the carriers that exist today, and <i>Analyst</i>’s exercise in paranoia comically reflects the negative perception of Ma Bell in the public eye. Here, The Phone Company (TPC) isn’t satisfied with its complete control of the communications network—it wants to be integrated into every U.S. citizen’s neural architecture from birth. Flicker opts to leave the dystopian fallout of this plan to the viewer’s imagination, in order to keep Arlington Hewes (played with superb robotic unctuousness by Pat Harrington Jr.), TCP’s president, relentlessly chipper. But just the concept of replacing names with numbers (which anticipates <i>THX 1138</i> by several years) is plenty discomfiting. </p>
<p>There’s also a great deal of paranoia about the burgeoning computer age reflected in the scene’s production design. Personal computers were still some years off in 1967, and room-sized behemoths involving multiple banks of circuitry still dominated the cultural landscape. Flicker thus crams the set with as many flashing lights as possible, while keeping the overall ambience dark and sinister. I haven’t been able to determine whether these machines were constructed expressly for the movie or whether Flicker just used existing technology—if pressed, I’d guess the former, because it’s hard for me to think up a useful function for all that constant blinking. Either way, the close-ups of Hewes, in which he’s always framed by out-of-focus lights rapidly switching on and off, convey an unmistakable sense of menace, which Flicker accentuates with repeated insert shots of computer-related imagery so abstract that it nearly looks hallucinogenic.</p>
<p>Coburn spends the entire scene trapped in a phone booth—the way it occasionally rotates around the room to provide him with a new viewing angle is a hilarious touch—and does an excellent slow burn as the insanity of his captor’s world-domination scheme is revealed. Most of the exposition arrives in the form of a short animated film, which today probably calls to mind <a href="http://www.avclub.com/article/20-years-later-ijurassic-parki-still-feels-like-th-105236"><i>Jurassic Park</i></a>’s explanation of how dinosaur DNA is recovered<i>.</i> Contemporary viewers, however, would have immediately recognized it as a parody of the The Bell Laboratory Science Series, which included such titles as “Our Mr. Sun,” “Hemo The Magnificent,” and “The Strange Case Of The Cosmic Rays” (all directed by Frank Capra). These fun essays were broadcast on TV between 1956 and 1964, and would still have been fresh in the public mind at the time. Flicker expertly mimics the look and tone of “Hemo The Magnificent,” in particular, putting a Machiavellian spin on something much beloved. </p>
<p>What seems most accurate here, and most relevant to our situation with high-speed Internet today, is the blithe way that Hewes, representing TPC, dismisses the public’s negative perception of their business model as some sort of weird aberration requiring legislative intervention. It’s been well documented that cable companies could offer much faster speeds at much cheaper prices than they currently do while still making a hefty profit—just not an obscene profit. With no competition to worry about, however, there’s no reason for them to refrain from gouging the consumer. Instead, they’ve used their muscle to achieve the legal right to restrict traffic as they see fit. Odds are this will soon be remedied (most likely by reclassifying the Internet as a common carrier), but so long as a single company serves most regions of the country, abuses will continue. Here’s hoping that someone will eventually concoct a satire of the situation as memorably nutty as this one.</p></div>]]>

That means Universal is now the first studio to hold both of the top spots since 1994, when Warner Bros. had <em>Ace Ventura: Pet Detective</em> and the Steven Seagal eco-thriller <em>On Deadly Ground</em>, and America had incredibly low standards. Meanwhile, <em>Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit</em> continued to prove that <a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-aarp-has-deemed-jack-ryan-shadow-recruit-its-f,107046/" target="_blank">grownups don’t go to movies anymore</a> by ceding last week’s fourth place spot back to <em><a href="http://www.avclub.com/review/frozen-is-another-step-forward-for-disney-princess-106037" target="_blank">Frozen</a></em>, which has now <a href="http://www.thewrap.com/frozen-passes-lion-king-810-million-global-box-office/" target="_blank">surpassed <em>The Lion King</em> to become Disney’s second-highest-grossing animated film of all time</a>, just behind <em>Finding Nemo</em>, if you don’t get into quibbles about inflation, whether the additional receipts from <em>The Lion King</em>’s and <em>Finding Nemo</em>’s 3-D re-releases should be counted, etc. Math is for grownups! Let’s play in the snow!</p>

And in just three theaters and a single theater, respectively, <a href="http://www.avclub.com/review/gloria-is-the-rare-film-to-explore-fiftysomething--200918" target="_blank"><em>Gloria</em></a> ($19,600) and <a href="http://www.avclub.com/review/the-bombastic-visitors-is-little-more-than-glorifi-200915" target="_blank">Visitors</a> ($10,700) entertained their modestly sized audiences with post-menopausal love stories and abstract museum art—two concepts from which most of the world would avert its eyes, like a handsome man rendered monstrous by a hideous, barely perceptible blemish.</p>

Texas State defeats heavily favored University Of Texas playing “iron man” football, <i>Necessary Roughness</i> (1991)<br></b><span style="background-color: transparent;">While Knute Rockne’s “Win one for the Gipper” speech might be the most famous motivational halftime talk in real history, it doesn’t hold a candle to Robert Loggia’s stirring tribute to recently hospitalized Texas State Fightin’ Armadillos coach Ed Gennero in </span><i style="background-color: transparent;">Necessary Roughness</i><span style="background-color: transparent;">. Throughout the season, the depleted team is forced to play “iron man” football; certain players must play both offense and defense. Not only that, the team is led by geriatrics Scott Bakula and Sinbad, two players in their 30s who somehow still have college eligibility. All isn’t lost, though. Even though the team’s losing in the final game of the season, the Fightin’ Armadillos assistant coach Wally Riggendorf (Loggia) rips off his shirt and tie at halftime and gives a speech for the ages, imploring players to, “Go out there, tear their fucking heads off, and you shit down their necks!” Iron man football be damned, Texas State went on to win one of the more improbable comebacks in cinematic college football history.</span></p>

<p><b style="background-color: transparent;">3. A huddle turns into a puking session, <i>The Replacements </i>(2000)<br></b><span style="background-color: transparent;">Loosely inspired by the 1987 NFL strike, </span><i style="background-color: transparent;">The Replacements</i><span style="background-color: transparent;"> asks what would happen if a professional NFL team was stocked with a group of people who had remarkable skills but didn’t fit the NFL mold. The result was a collection of boat cleaners, mini-mart employees, convicts, and other reprobates more likely to start a brawl than win a game. It’s a rough transition period, as ex-sumo wrestler Jumbo (Ace Yonamine) learns after devouring a pre-game meal of hard-boiled eggs. A bad choice for an active sport, as Jumbo throws up the entire meal in the middle of a huddle and sets off teammate Clifford (Orlando Jones) to do the same. Unable to break the huddle but risking a chain reaction of vomit, quarterback Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves) leads the team to trot in unison away from the mess, a sight so remarkable it causes long-time football commentators John Madden and Pat Summerall (playing themselves) to look back over their 19-year careers. “Have we ever seen anything like this?” Madden asks his partner. “Not on the football field,” Summerall muses.</span></p><p><b>4. An offensive lineman gets “power bombed” and glacier water resurrects a linebacker<i>, The Waterboy </i>(1998)<br></b><span style="background-color: transparent;">To be fair, everything about </span><i style="background-color: transparent;">The Waterboy </i><span style="background-color: transparent;">is far-fetched—dim-witted waterboy Bobby Boucher (Adam Sandler) works for a bottom-of-the-barrel college team but unleashes heretofore unseen reserves of rage-fueled strength to become the game’s most feared linebacker, smashing quarterbacks away like toothpick sculptures. When he makes it to the Bourbon Bowl things get even weirder, as he’s pitted against the team that tormented him for years, led by offensive lineman Meaney (Todd Holland). On one play, he channels his favorite wrestler and charges through the other players, picking the other man up and pile-driving him into the ground with a cheerful explanation: “Power bomb! Compliments of Captain Insano.” Boucher’s almost taken out of the game himself later, but is magically brought back by way of his girlfriend, Vicki (</span><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000103/?ref_=tt_cl_t4" style="background-color: transparent;">Fairuza Balk</a><span style="background-color: transparent;">), pouring glacier water blessed by an Alaskan medicine man down his throat.</span></p>

<p><b style="background-color: transparent;">5. Quarterback experiences death and rebirth at the Super Bowl<i>, Heaven Can Wait </i>(</b><b style="background-color: transparent;">1978)<br></b><span style="background-color: transparent;">In the whimsical romance </span><i style="background-color: transparent;">Heaven Can Wait</i><span style="background-color: transparent;">, Warren Beatty plays Joe Pendleton, a superstar quarterback determined to lead his team to victory in the Super Bowl. Unfortunately, an overeager angel, trying to spare him unnecessary pain, yanks Joe’s soul out of his body seconds before a bicycle accident that he was fated to survive. In the end, a quarterback for the Los Angeles Rams is mortally injured during the Super Bowl, and heavenly fixer Mr. Jordan (James Mason) smoothly transfers Joe’s soul into the dead player’s body. He jumps up, re-enters the game, and the Rams emerge victorious. Sadly, the supernatural elements of this climax are invisible to the spectators in the stands, who will never know they’ve been witness to back-to-back firsts: The first on-the-field death and resurrection in the history of the big game.</span></p><p><b>6. Players ride a garbage-can chariot into the end zone<i>, Horse Feathers </i></b><b>(1932)<br></b><span style="background-color: transparent;">In the Marx Brothers’ greatest and most anarchic picture, </span><i style="background-color: transparent;">Duck Soup</i><span style="background-color: transparent;">, Groucho is made president of a small country, allowing the Brothers to satirize self-serving government incompetence and hollow appeals to patriotism. In the stellar warm-up effort </span><i style="background-color: transparent;">Horse Feathers</i><span style="background-color: transparent;">, Groucho is made president of Huxley College, and the Brothers satirize what they recognize as the entire point of higher education in America: college football. All the Marxes take part in the climactic big game between Huxley and its hated rival, Darwin College, but the MVP is definitely Harpo; after tying the ball to his finger with an elastic band and swinging it about like a yo-yo, he and his brothers pile into a trash can that’s yoked to a pair of horses and literally ride it across the field for the final touchdown.</span></p>

Prison guards and convicts work out their differences on the field<i>, The Longest Yard</i></b><b style="background-color: transparent;"> (1974)<br></b><span style="background-color: transparent;">In Robert Aldrich’s </span><i style="background-color: transparent;">The Longest Yard</i><span style="background-color: transparent;">, Burt Reynolds plays a disgraced and debauched former pro quarterback who rediscovers his integrity in prison, leading a team of convicts to victory over a team of thuggish guards in a game that the football-fanatic warden (Eddie Albert) has cooked up to break the prisoners’ spirit. Thanks to Reynolds, the warden’s scheme backfires, but not until after a series of bone-crunching, crippling altercations that would be broken up by a SWAT team if anyone attempted them in a real game. By the end, the head guard (Ed Lauter) is so disillusioned and so disgusted with the warden’s Gestapo tactics that he refuses a direct order and does not shoot Reynolds dead for “attempting to escape” when he’s really just ambling to the edge of the field to collect the game ball. (The movie has been remade, ineffectually, twice: once as a 2005 comedy with macho muscleman Adam Sandler in the Reynolds part, and as the 2001 English movie </span><i style="background-color: transparent;">Mean Machine</i><span style="background-color: transparent;">, in which the sport is changed to soccer—or, as it’s called in the rest of the world, football.)</span></p><p><b>8-10. Terrorists blow up the big game<i>, Black Sunday</i></b><b> (1977); <i>The Sum Of All Fears</i> (2002); <i>The Dark Knight Rises </i>(2012)<br></b><span style="background-color: transparent;">By the late 1970s, football had gone far enough in displacing baseball as the country’s No. 1 pro-sports obsession that it inevitably drew the attention of movie terrorists looking to deliver a body blow to the American way of life. In John Frankenheimer’s </span><i style="background-color: transparent;">Black Sunday</i><span style="background-color: transparent;"> (based on a novel by Thomas Harris, the creator of Hannibal Lector), PLO terrorists allied with a bitterly unhinged Vietnam vet (Bruce Dern) hope to explode the Goodyear blimp as it hovers over the field during the Super Bowl. They failed. In the Tom Clancy adaptation </span><i style="background-color: transparent;">The Sum Of All Fears</i><span style="background-color: transparent;">, neo-Nazis trying to instigate World War III set off a nuclear device at a football game attended by the president. POTUS escapes in the nick of time, though the villains do manage to level Baltimore—a mixed success at best. More recently, the supervillain Bane (Tom Hardy) in </span><i style="background-color: transparent;">The Dark Knight Rises</i><span style="background-color: transparent;"> pulled off the most triumphant feat of football-themed movie terrorism to date, imploding the field at the start of a game to introduce himself to the people of Gotham.</span></p>

<p><b style="background-color: transparent;">11. A choreographed “Single Ladies” number wins the game, <i>Glee</i>, “Preggers” (2009)<br></b><span style="background-color: transparent;">There’s improbable, and then there’s choreography. Back in </span><i style="background-color: transparent;">Glee</i><span style="background-color: transparent;">’s first season, when there was still palpable tension between the football team and the glee club—and when Kurt was still not out to his father—the football team used Beyoncé’s “Single Ladies” as an </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bxoFBeHeDA" style="background-color: transparent;">on-field diversion</a><span style="background-color: transparent;">. There’s some plot built in to make it feel a little more probable: Kurt tried out for the football team to impress his father, and he turns out to be a not-half-bad kicker—in part because he’s using “Single Ladies” to concentrate. And Mr. Schuster had already taught the football players the “Single Ladies” dance as a kind of pre-game warm-up. But all that matters is that at some point when William McKinley High has possession, Finn calls for “the play”—and the entire team, in full football gear, breaks out into choreographed Beyoncé. It’s one of those moments that indicated how risky and weird and fun </span><i style="background-color: transparent;">Glee</i><span style="background-color: transparent;"> was willing to be—and it brought Beyoncé to a football field well before her halftime performance. Because this is television, the ruse works: The opposing team is so perplexed that Puck manages to steal the ball and score a touchdown. Then Kurt uses his jam to score the game-winning point. As unlikely as this is to occur at the Super Bowl, it’s still impossible to forget the sight of all those football players breaking it down.</span></p>

<p><b style="background-color: transparent;">12. A Yugoslavian mule kicks a team all the way to the Super Bowl</b><b style="background-color: transparent;">, <i>Gus</i> (1976)<br></b><span style="background-color: transparent;">Long before golden retrievers began their gradual takeover of the motion picture industry, mules made a major impact in Hollywood, with Frances The Talking Mule’s seminal work throughout the 1950s paving the way for Disney to make a film about a football-playing mule named Gus. Originally, Gus is a lowly soccer-playing mule based in Yugoslavia, but when word of his ball-handling skills makes its way to the owner and coach of the California Atoms (played by Ed Asner and Don Knotts, respectively), it’s decided that Gus has potential as a seat-filling halftime act. Once they see the mule in action, however, they realize that he’s actually a better kicker than anyone else on their roster, so after they confirm that it’s not technically against the rules, they bring him aboard, a decision that turns the Atoms’ fortunes around so dramatically that Gus and the guys make it all the way to the Super Bowl. While a far cry from </span><i style="background-color: transparent;">Any Given Sunday</i><span style="background-color: transparent;">, it’s amazing how much disbelief one can suspend with a cast that also includes Tim Conway, Dick Van Patten, and Tom Bosley, along with color commentators Dick Enberg, Johnny Unitas, and former </span><i style="background-color: transparent;">Hogan’s Heroes</i><span style="background-color: transparent;"> star Bob Crane.</span></p>

<p><b style="background-color: transparent;">13-14. Even more animals play football, <i>Air Bud: Golden Receiver</i> (1998) and <i>Bonzo Goes To College</i> (1952)<br></b><span style="background-color: transparent;">A mule that can kick a long field goal is a fantastic feat, but that’s a special teams gimmick. What about the animal players in skill positions? </span><i style="background-color: transparent;">Bonzo Goes To College</i><span style="background-color: transparent;">, the sequel to </span><i style="background-color: transparent;">Bedtime For Bonzo</i><span style="background-color: transparent;"> (which starred then-future U.S. president Ronald Reagan), sees the former lab chimp escaping a carnival sideshow and getting adopted by the granddaughter of a small-town college football coach. Once there, the newly literate Bonzo passes the tests necessary to make the team, thus providing cruel fodder for anyone making jokes about NCAA academic eligibility. </span><i style="background-color: transparent;">Air Bud:</i><span style="background-color: transparent;"> </span><i style="background-color: transparent;">Golden Receiver</i><span style="background-color: transparent;">—the second and final </span><i style="background-color: transparent;">Air Bud</i><span style="background-color: transparent;"> film to get a theatrical release—discovers that Buddy, fresh off his basketball court success, can also be a skilled route-runner for the middle school football team. (Despite once again not actually attending the school, which any opponent would logically contest makes him ineligible.) Football has never been more far-fetched than with a dog lined up at receiver.</span></p><p><b>15. A beautiful blonde turns politically incorrect young punks into winners</b><b>, <i>Wildcats</i> (1986)<br></b><span style="background-color: transparent;">The ’80s wasn’t a great decade for football comedies, but it had a strong showing in the field of occasionally amusing Goldie Hawn films, one of which revolved around the daughter of a much-admired football coach who wants to follow in her father’s footsteps, no matter how difficult a task it may prove to be. It’s a testament to how little faith the powers that be have in Molly McGrath (Hawn) that the only gig they’re willing to give her is at Central High School, an educational institution filled with sexist, racist teenage athletes—including Woody Harrelson, Wesley Snipes, and Mykelti Williamson—who find the idea of having her as their coach to be absolutely preposterous. Molly’s enthusiasm remains unflagging for an extended period of time, and just as her gusto starts to go, her team conveniently comes around and decides they’re willing to take her coaching seriously. As a result, the team ends up taking home the glory against Prescott High School, resulting in high-fives all around and a performance of LL Cool J’s “Football Rap” over the closing credits.</span></p>

<p><b style="background-color: transparent;">16. Liz Lemon: varsity placekicker, <i>30 Rock</i>, “Ludachristmas” (2007)<br></b><span style="background-color: transparent;">As often as </span><i style="background-color: transparent;">30 Rock</i><span style="background-color: transparent;"> used Jack Donaghy as a target for quick jabs at conservative policies and 1-percenter myopia, the show never went easy on his liberal foil, Liz Lemon. Though </span><i style="background-color: transparent;">30 Rock</i><span style="background-color: transparent;">’s POV is squarely in Liz’s corner—she was played by series creator Tina Fey, after all—it recognized that her passion for certain causes often led her to bite off more than she could chew. The second-season holiday extravaganza, “Ludachristmas,” set up such a scenario, introducing its protagonist’s short-lived football career via cutaway gag. The lawsuit that allowed Liz to suit up for the White Haven High School squad was a matter of principle—”Yeah! Feminism!” she declares after a squibbed kick—but it also caused her and her teammates to miss the playoffs. (“But I think we led the league in bravery,” she proudly qualifies.) Not that her extra point for equality was the true cause of White Haven’s season-ending disappointment: As illustrated later in the episode, the game took place in early December, suggesting the team was on the verge of a postseason berth. Maybe disappointed White Haven boosters like “It Wouldn’t Be A Lemon Party Without Old” Dick Lemon should’ve blamed their coach for putting an unseasoned newcomer at such a crucial position. As Liz herself might’ve said to the blunder, “A-doy-ee.”</span></p><p><b>17. A star player brings a gun on the field<i>, The Last Boy Scout</i> (1991)<br></b><span style="background-color: transparent;">In a torrential downpour on the world’s darkest football field, the Los Angeles Stallions find themselves losing to the Cleveland Cats. During halftime, star player Billy Cole (future Tae Bo pitchman Billy Blanks) gets a phone call from an unidentified man who reminds him how much money is on the line, so he’d better “start scoring some touchdowns.” Later, with little time remaining on the clock, and the Stallions needing a touchdown to win the game—apparently the spread doesn’t matter?—Cole catches a pass from the quarterback and eludes a pair of tackles with the end zone in sight. When a Cats player looks like he has him for an open-field tackle, Cole pulls a gun out of his uniform and shoots the guy and two other Cats on his way to the end zone. Inexplicably, the teams immediately run out to the filed to surround Cole, and before law enforcement can arrive, he turns to everyone and says, “Ain’t life a bitch?” before putting the gun to his head and pulling the trigger.</span></p>

                <![CDATA[<img src=http://i.onionstatic.com/avclub/5013/60/16x9/565.jpg /><div><p>Best known for their work with the Dardenne Brothers, cinematographer Alain Marcoen and editor Marie-Hélène Dozo seem like an odd fit for a piece of “inspirational” treacle like <i>Gimme Shelter</i>. Essentially a fundraising puff piece, the movie depicts life in one of the Catholic shelters run by Kathy DiFiore (Ann Dowd) from the perspective of Apple (Vanessa Hudgens), a pregnant teenager who comes to DiFiore’s attention after running away from her welfare-collecting mother and then being pressured into getting an abortion by her father’s treacherous French wife. Government programs and social workers are depicted as uncaring and ineffective, while DiFiore’s privately funded shelter is shown as an idyllic safe haven. Much is made of Ronald Reagan’s endorsement of DiFiore’s program, which should give viewers an idea of <i>Gimme Shelter</i>’s intended audience.</p><p>There’s nothing wrong with social-cause filmmaking, and the movie’s chief problem is less its political talking points than the corny way it tries to impart them, pitting one-dimensional monsters—of which Apple’s mother, June (Rosario Dawson, wearing fake yellow Halloween teeth), is the worst—against saintly figures like DiFiore and Father McCarthy (James Earl Jones). Marcoen’s Super 16mm camerawork will occasionally lend the drama a sense of reality (he’s a master of the immediate, locked-in-on-a-subject handheld camera), only to have director Ron Krauss’ script drag the movie back into contrived preachiness. For instance, just as Apple gets settled into life at the shelter, June arrives, smoking indoors and talking about all the money they’re going to get from the government. Of course the viewer has to root for Apple to stay in the shelter; the problem, though, is that real parent-child relationships—even with abusive or neglectful parents—tend to be more complicated.</p><p>Dawson’s performance is cartoonish, but Hudgens’ is embarrassing. De-glamorized, with short hair, acne, and patches of dark facial hair along her cheeks, Hudgens looks the part of a downtrodden teenager. The problem is with how she sounds, awkwardly trying—and failing—to tackle Krauss’ slang-heavy dialogue, over-stressing every bit of vernacular grammar as though saying it louder will make it seem more authentic. (Her pronunciation of “aks” is especially painful.) Because Apple’s voice never comes naturally to Hudgens, she struggles to emote; the anxiety and frustration that supposedly define her character are never palpable.</p><p>  

  

  

  

  

  This leaves a glaring hole in the center of 

<i>Gimme Shelter</i>. Aside from some (possibly unintentional) sapphic tension between Apple and her shelter roommate, Cassie (Emily Meade), and a competent performance from Brendan Fraser as Apple’s dad, the film feels emotionless—a crippling flaw for a melodrama that’s trying to make the argument that group shelters are, emotionally, the best environment for teenage mothers. Occasionally, Marcoen’s camerawork and Dozo’s attentive editing are able to create the impression that Apple has an interior life; however, as soon as Hudgens has to perform instead of merely walking around or staring off into space, that impression disappears.      <br></p></div>]]>

<p>TV writer Nell Scovell, who helped Sandberg with the book, will handle the script, drawing on her experience with strong female characters on shows like <i>Murphy Brown</i> and, uh, <i>Sabrina The Teenage Witch</i>.

Everything is chosen for maximum dorky/cool factor; characters have names like Naberius and Zuriel, demons explode into clouds of cinder and ash, and the monster—who prefers to be called “Adam”—rocks a trench coat and boot-cut jeans.</p><p>This sort of dorkiness can—and should—be fun, but rarely is, because of the <i>Underworld </i>movies’ compulsive self-seriousness and lack of flavor. <i>I, Frankenstein </i>therefore registers as something of an improvement; though it’s almost as humorless as <i>Underworld</i>, it’s also packed with comic-book panel compositions and extreme angles, creating a visual style that fits the material. The imagery is shamelessly derivative—pulled from <i>The Matrix</i>, <i>Diablo II</i>, and the animated series <i>Gargoyles</i>, among countless other sources—but seeing it mashed together has an amusing effect, similar to watching costumed fans interact with one another at a convention.</p><p>If the 2009 prequel <a href="http://www.avclub.com/review/underworld-rise-of-the-lycans-23019"><i>Underworld: Rise Of The Lycans</i></a>—which presupposed that people were eager for an entire feature’s worth of backstory to two movies that were already mostly world-building and exposition—represented the <i>Underworld </i>style at its most Byzantine, then <i>I, Frankenstein </i>represents it at its most palatable. Without a Kate Beckinsale-type to fetishize, or an unnecessarily large number of supporting characters to reference, the movie barrels along from one group battle to another. None are exciting, but, as effects-heavy pop-cultural mash-ups go, they’re interesting to watch, with hordes of demons swarming, zombie-style, over the buttresses of a cathedral while angel-winged gargoyles keep shifting from human to statue form for no clear reason.</p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Like the movies it’s modeled on, </span><i style="background-color: transparent;">I, Frankenstein </i><span style="background-color: transparent;">provides plenty of opportunity to hear actors say stupid things; Miranda Otto, for one, deserves some kind of award for being able to say “I am the queen of the Gargoyle Order” with a straight face. Seemingly unintentional laughs abound. However, there’s a rare moment of near-self-awareness late in the film, when symbolically named mortal scientist Terra (Yvonne Strahovski) tells Adam that, while she’s willing to believe the Frankenstein story is true and he is in fact a 200-year-old reanimated corpse, she simply cannot accept the existence of demons or shape-shifting statues. At that point, a demon leaps in through a window, Terra mutters “shit,” and the story keeps moving along, uninterrupted. This scene—the film’s only intentional laugh—registers as an acknowledgement that camp is best unspoiled. But if the film is made with the understanding that campiness needs to be straight-faced to be funny, then are its “unintentional” laughs really that unintentional?</span><br></p></div>]]>

                <div><p><i>Hotel Rwanda </i>screenwriter Keir Pearson is set to pen a new Mother Teresa biopic. According to<i> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.deadline.com/2014/01/mother-teresa-movie-keir-pearson-screenwriter-flame-ventures/">Deadline</a>, I Thirst</i> is being produced with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.motherteresa.org/">The Mother Teresa Center</a>, and Pearson—who recently co-wrote a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/30/cesar-chavez-trailer_n_4179170.html" target="_blank">biopic of Cesar Chavez</a>—reportedly plans to complete research trips to India and Mexico before starting work on the script by the end of February. The goal is to begin production at the end of 2014 ahead of a 2015 release date.</p>
<p> <i>I Thirst </i>producer Tony Krantz gave high praise to the screenwriter, saying, “Keir’s presentation and his Oscar-nominated script of <em>Hotel Rwanda</em> and his sensitive script for <em>Chavez</em> made him the perfect choice. <em>I Thirst</em> is the first and only authorized film about the life of Mother Teresa on the big screen. We couldn’t be more excited for this movie about a woman who stood for total commitment, faith, charity and love.”</p></div>

                <div><p>In something of a “best of times, worst of times” scenario, Nicole Kidman’s Grace Kelly biopic, <i><a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/grace-of-monaco,102906/" target="_blank">Grace Of Monaco</a></i>, has <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/weinstein-company-pulls-nicole-kidmans-673563" target="_blank">lost its U.S. premiere date</a>, but earned the                   prestigious     <a href="http://variety.com/2014/film/news/grace-of-monaco-to-open-cannes-festival-1201069222/" target="_blank">opening slot at the Cannes Film Festival</a> on May 14. The Cannes announcement comes just one day after the Weinstein Company officially pulled the film from its March 14 U.S. premiere. It’s all part of a public battle over final cut between U.S. distributor Harvey Weinstein and the film’s French director Olivier Dahan (<i>La Vie En Rose</i>), which also saw the film pushed from its original late 2013 premiere—where it might have been an awards contender—to the less-desirable March 2014 date.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/heres-who-harvey-weinstein-is-fighting-with-this-w,104446/" target="_blank">As previously reported</a>, Weinstein claimed the initial setback was due to the film just not being ready, while Dahan maintained that it all came down to Weinstein’s demands to re-edit the film to create a more “Hollywood” version. <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/grace-monaco-director-bashes-harvey-649447" target="_blank">Speaking to the French newspaper <em>Liberation</em>,</a> Dahn said, “They want a commercial film smelling of daisies, taking out anything that exceeds that which is too abrupt, everything that makes it cinematic and breathe with life. A lot of things are missing.” Now the dust has settled, and presumably it's the daisy-free version that will be the one screened at arguably the most important film festival in the world.</p>
<p>So, while Weinstein successfully flexed his distribution muscles, the prestigious Cannes slot and sympathetic press seem to make Dahan the clear winner in this battle of art vs. commerce, which has somehow come to be represented by a film in which Nicole Kidman plays a movie-star-turned-princess. <em>Grace Of Monaco</em> is now set to open on May 14 in France and other international cities, but no U.S. debut has been confirmed yet.</p></div>]]>

This Louis C.K.-voiced dog will contend with his jealousy over his master’s newest rescue, a “sloppy mongrel” voiced by <i>Modern Family</i>’s Eric Stonestreet, as well as “the mean streets of New York,” when both dogs find themselves locked outside.</p>
<p>On their quest to return home, they also encounter the “adorable white bunny Snowball,” whose anger at being abandoned by his owners leads him to form an army of strays and take revenge on humanity, and comes expressed in the shrill, excitable voice of Kevin Hart. The film is expected to confirm what all dog owners have long suspected: Sure, they spend a lot of time on their balls, but they’re just gathering material for their next special.</p>
<p>Anyway, Louis C.K. has experience with speaking for dogs, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FFyNyfOqQQ" target="_blank">this early <i>Conan O’Brien</i> clip</a> confirms.  </p>
